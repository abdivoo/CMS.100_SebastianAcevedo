Artificial intelligence will take a front row seat this fall in Dr. Natalie Nelson-Marsh's 'Future of Work' Organizational Communication class at the University of Portland.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250416632459/en/
University of Portland Ethical AI Initiative will launch in six courses across the academic spectrum in the 2025-26 school year.
Students won't simply rely on AI tools and tasks to complete assignments, however. They'll hold AI up to the light, and, through an ethical lens, examine how this ubiquitous technology is rapidly disrupting the global workforce they're about to join.
The Future of Work is one of six courses set to pilot the University of Portland's Ethical AI Initiative - a campus-wide endeavor to explore the ethical and societal impacts of artificial intelligence in various fields of study.
Launching in the 2025-26 academic year, the Ethical AI Initiative includes Dr. Hannah Highlander's mathematics course, 'Ordinary Differential Equations,' which will guide sophomore-and-junior level students to critically examine the ethical implications of mathematical modeling in machine learning.
The initiative will cross over to business analytics, technology in education, and AI's influence on society. As Dr. Nelson-Marsh sizes up the future workplace, she says students in all majors will benefit from grasping AI's impact on organizational culture.
""When students understand how human-AI collaboration shapes the way we organize, they are empowered not just to use these technologies - but to integrate them ethically,"" Dr. Nelson-Marsh said. ""This involves more than future-proofing our students' careers. It's about leading conversations that will define the future of work itself.""
Dr. Valerie Banschbach, Dean of UP's College of Arts and Sciences, says UP is one of the first universities in the nation to offer a cross-curricular Ethical AI Initiative.
""As a Catholic, Holy Cross University, we seek to develop the whole person, and that includes accompanying our students as they navigate an AI-shaped world,"" Dr. Banschbach said. ""As we launch this Ethical AI Initiative, it is our aim to incorporate AI tools as we teach about this emerging technology through an ethical lens - providing critical AI literacy and values-based framing.""
""Our Ethical AI Initiative beautifully reflects our mission and priorities at the University of Portland,"" said Dr. David Mengel, University Provost. ""It offers all our students, whatever their major, opportunities both to use powerful, new AI technologies and also to ask how and for what purposes these tools should be applied.""
The 2025-26 Ethical AI Initiative builds off the University's commitment to curricular innovation and dialogue in the burgeoning AI arena. Last fall, UP welcomed faculty, administrators and religious affiliates from 19 institutions for a national conference: Catholic Higher Education and AI: Mission-Based Teaching for the Future of Humanity. UP is making plans to host its second AI conference for Catholic higher education leaders in October.

 The University of Technology and Applied Sciences (UTAS), in collaboration with the ICESCO Chair in AI Ethics and the Human Resources Development Committee at the UTAS Ibri branch, organised a virtual symposium on April 15, titled 'An Introduction to How Universities Can Ethically Adopt Artificial Intelligence.' The symposium, targeted at global faculty members and students and featured Azhar Ziaur Rahman, an international expert in governance and digital transformation.
It was moderated by Dr Himlatha Gunasekaran from the Ibri branch.
Discussions focused on AI's significance in higher education, phased and ethical adoption methods and strategic future steps.
With 158 participants including 141 academic and administrative staff; and 17 students the session highlighted that AI is no longer a future prospect but a present-day imperative, demanding clear ethical frameworks and transparent standards.
Survey feedback showed strong engagement and a desire for more training in ethical AI applications.
In continuation of these efforts, UTAS participated in an interactive workshop during Unesco AI Chair Day at Sultan Qaboos University in Muscat on April 17.
Led by Dr Musab al Rawi and Dr Preethi Bhaskar, the workshop addressed ethical challenges in AI integration, presenting case studies and forming key recommendations like establishing governance policies, bias detection mechanisms and transparency protocols.
Both events reflected a growing awareness in Omani academic circles of the urgent need to integrate AI responsibly.
They also demonstrated a collective commitment to shaping a future where artificial intelligence enhances learning without compromising ethical and human values, setting a model for other institutions in the region to follow.

The World Health Organization (WHO) today designated the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands as a WHO Collaborating Centre on artificial intelligence (AI) for health governance.
AI has the potential to re-shape health care, save lives and improve health and well-being. However, harnessing its benefits for good requires collaboration from stakeholders committed to robust governance, ethical safeguards, and evidence-based policies.
The WHO Collaborating Centre designation recognizes the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology's decades-long history of cutting-edge research on responsible innovation, and its leadership in incorporating ethical values into design requirements for digital technologies. This inauguration marks the continuation of a strong partnership between the Digital Ethics Centre and WHO with the two entities jointly organizing international consultations, workshops, and the development of normative guidance and training in the past.
WHO is committed to helping Member States plan, govern, and adopt responsible AI technologies, said Dr Alain Labrique, Director of Digital Health and Innovation at WHO. We are witnessing remarkable progress, with AI poised to transform health systems and support individuals on their health journeys. To ensure these benefits reach everyone ethically, safely, and equitably, we rely on strong technical and academic partnerships that guide us in this rapidly evolving field.
The Collaborating Centre on AI for health governance will be instrumental in WHO's efforts to ensure the ethical and responsible use of AI for health by advancing research on priority topics and providing expert input for WHO's guidance development and policy-making. The Centre will serve as a hub for education and advocacy for science-driven research and facilitate knowledge-sharing and training through regional and country-level workshops.
The fruit of two decades of research in digital ethics and responsible innovation, the Delft Digital Ethics Centre is one of the frontrunners in operationalizing ethical values into design requirements for digital technologies such as artificial intelligence,"" Professor Jeroen van den Hoven, Scientific Director at Delft Digital Ethics Centre noted. ""We look forward to contributing to the global health community and advancing the responsible use of AI in health.""
The Responsible and Ethical AI for Healthcare Lab, a collaboration between Delft University of Technology and its partners, will provide valuable insight into the challenges involved in the successful implementation of WHO guidance in clinical practice. ""The designation of the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology as a WHO Collaborating Centre strengthens our collective ability to ensure AI serves public health equitably and responsibly. This collaboration will play a critical role in supporting Member States to navigate the opportunities and challenges of AI, fostering trust, transparency, and innovation in digital health, said Dr David Novillo-Ortiz, Regional Adviser and Unit Head for Data, Evidence and Digital Health at WHO's Regional Office for Europe.
The Collaborating Centre on AI for health emphasizes WHO's dedication to evidence-based AI governance, promoting its responsible use while upholding the highest ethical standards.

Load-Date: March 22, 2025","The World Health Organization (WHO) today designated the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands as a WHO Collaborating Centre on artificial intelligence (AI) for health governance.
AI has the potential to re-shape health care, save lives and improve health and well-being. However, harnessing its benefits for good requires collaboration from stakeholders committed to robust governance, ethical safeguards, and evidence-based policies.
The WHO Collaborating Centre designation recognizes the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology's decades-long history of cutting-edge research on responsible innovation, and its leadership in incorporating ethical values into design requirements for digital technologies. This inauguration marks the continuation of a strong partnership between the Digital Ethics Centre and WHO with the two entities jointly organizing international consultations, workshops, and the development of normative guidance and training in the past.
WHO is committed to helping Member States plan, govern, and adopt responsible AI technologies, said Dr Alain Labrique, Director of Digital Health and Innovation at WHO. We are witnessing remarkable progress, with AI poised to transform health systems and support individuals on their health journeys. To ensure these benefits reach everyone ethically, safely, and equitably, we rely on strong technical and academic partnerships that guide us in this rapidly evolving field.
The Collaborating Centre on AI for health governance will be instrumental in WHO's efforts to ensure the ethical and responsible use of AI for health by advancing research on priority topics and providing expert input for WHO's guidance development and policy-making. The Centre will serve as a hub for education and advocacy for science-driven research and facilitate knowledge-sharing and training through regional and country-level workshops.
The fruit of two decades of research in digital ethics and responsible innovation, the Delft Digital Ethics Centre is one of the frontrunners in operationalizing ethical values into design requirements for digital technologies such as artificial intelligence,"" Professor Jeroen van den Hoven, Scientific Director at Delft Digital Ethics Centre noted. ""We look forward to contributing to the global health community and advancing the responsible use of AI in health.""

March 3rd, 2025 ( Digital Journal  - Delivered by  Newstex )
As more companies adopt generative artificial intelligence models, AI ethics is becoming increasingly important. Ethical guidelines to ensure the transparent, fair, and safe use of AI are evolving across industries, albeit slowly when compared to the fast-moving technology.
But thorny questions about equity and ethics may force companies to tap the brakes on development if they want to maintain consumer trust and buy-in.
KPMG's 2024 Generative AI Consumer Trust Survey found that about half of consumers think there is not sufficient regulation of generative AI right now. The lack of oversight tracks with limited trust that institutions-particularly tech companies and the federal government-will ethically develop and implement AI, according to KPMG.
Within the tech industry, ethical initiatives have been set back by a  lack of resources and leadership support, according to an article presented at the 2023 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency. Layoffs at major corporations, including Amazon's streaming platform Twitch, Microsoft, Google, and X, hit employees focused on ethical AI hard, leaving a vacuum.
While nearly 3 in 4 consumers say they trust organizations using GenAI in daily operations, confidence in AI varies between industries and functions. Just over half of consumers trust AI to deliver educational resources and personalized recommendations, compared to less than a third who trust it for investment advice and self-driving cars. Consumers are open to AI-driven restaurant recommendations, but not, it seems with their money or their life.
Clear concerns persist around the broader use of a technology that has elevated scams and deepfakes to a new level. The KPMG survey found that the biggest consumer concerns are the spread of misinformation, fake news, and biased content, as well as the proliferation of more sophisticated phishing scams and cybersecurity breaches. As AI grows more sophisticated, these concerns are likely to be amplified as more people may potentially be negatively affected-making ethical frameworks for approaching AI all the more essential.
That puts the onus to set ethical guardrails upon companies and lawmakers. In May 2024, Colorado became the first state to introduce  legislation with provisions for consumer protection and accountability from companies and developers introducing AI systems used in education, financial services, and other critical, high-risk industries.
As other states evaluate similar legislation for consumer and employee protections, companies especially possess the in-the-weeds insight to address high-risk situations specific to their businesses. While consumers have set a high bar for companies' responsible use of AI, the KPMG report also found that organizations can take concrete steps to garner and maintain public trust-education, clear communication and human oversight to catch errors, biases, or ethical concerns.
The reality is that the tension between proceeding cautiously to address ethical concerns and moving full speed ahead to capitalize on the competitive advantages of AI will continue to play out in the coming years.
Drata analyzed current events to identify five ways companies are ethically incorporating artificial intelligence in the workplace.

Actively supporting a culture of ethical decision-making
AI initiatives within the financial services industry can speed up innovation, but companies need to take care in protecting the financial system and customer information from criminals. To that end, JPMorgan Chase has a 200-person AI research group, including an ethics team to work on the company's AI initiatives. The company ranks top on the Evident AI Index, which looks at banks' AI readiness, including a top ranking for transparency in the responsible use of AI.

Development of risk assessment frameworks
The National Institute of Standards and Technology has developed an  AI Risk Management Framework that helps companies better plan and grow their AI initiatives. The approach supports companies in identifying the risks posed by AI, defining and measuring ethical activity, and implementing AI systems with fairness, reliability, and transparency. The Vatican is even getting in on the action-it collaborated with the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, a Catholic college in Silicon Valley, to recommend specific steps for companies to navigate AI technologies ethically.

Specialized training in responsible AI usage
Amazon Web Services has developed many tools and guides to help its employees think and act ethically as they develop AI applications. The  Responsible AI course, a YouTube series produced by AWS Machine Learning University, serves as an introductory course that covers fairness criteria and methods for mitigating bias. Amazon's SageMaker Clarify tool helps developers detect bias in AI model predictions.

Communication of AI mission and values
Companies that develop a mission statement around their AI practices clearly communicate their values and priorities to employees, customers, and other company stakeholders. Examples include Dell Technologies'  Principles for Ethical Artificial Intelligence and IBM's AI ethics, which clarify their approach to AI application development and implementation, publicly setting guiding principles such as 'respecting cultural norms, furthering social equality, and ensuring environmental sustainability.'

Implementing an AI ethics board
Companies can create AI ethics advisory boards to help them find and fix the ethical risks around AI tools, particularly systems that produce biased output because they were trained with biased or discriminatory data. SAP has had an AI Ethics Advisory Panel since 2018; it works on current ethical issues and looks ahead to identify potential future problems and solutions. Northeastern University has created an independent AI ethics advisory board to work with companies that prefer not to create their own.

2025 APR 17 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Education Daily Report -- Data detailed on educational technology have been presented. According to news reporting out of Auburn University by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""This study developed and validated the AI Ethical Reflection Scale (AIERS), a tool for measuring university students' ethical reflection on AI in three dimensions: AI ethical awareness, AI critical evaluation, and AI for social good."" 
 Funders for this research include University Grants Commission - Hong Kong. 
 The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Auburn University: ""This study used a sample of 730 university students, and confirmatory factor analysis supported the three-dimensional structure of the AIERS, which demonstrated good internal consistency and construct validity. Additionally, we found evidence of convergent and discriminant validity, as AI ethical reflection was positively yet modestly correlated with AI literacy, indicating that AI ethical reflection is a related yet distinct construct from AI literacy. The study also explored the differences in AI ethical reflection based on gender, academic discipline, and prior AI experience. The results revealed that female students exhibited higher AI ethical awareness than male students. Furthermore, frequent AI users reported significantly greater AI ethical reflection across all dimensions than those who used AI less frequently or had never used it. However, no significant differences were found between Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) and non-STEM students."" 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Collectively, these findings emphasize the importance of integrating ethical considerations and hands-on AI experiences from diverse perspectives of gender in AI education across disciplines to promote the ethical and responsible use of AI among university students.""

In an age where data drives  decision-making across industries, the ethical implications of advanced analytics are more significant than ever. Lokeshkumar Madabathula, a researcher in the field of data science, explores the challenges and solutions in balancing innovation with privacy and ethical considerations. His insights shed light on the evolving role of data professionals and the necessity of ethical frameworks in technological progress. Organizations that fail to address ethical concerns risk damaging their reputation and facing regulatory penalties. Ethical principles should not hinder technological progress but rather serve as a guiding force in creating sustainable and fair data-driven solutions.
Privacy-Preserving Analytics: A Necessary Evolution
As digital landscapes expand, organizations must adopt privacy-preserving techniques to maintain user trust. Innovative solutions, such as decentralized data architectures and anonymization methods, have emerged to address growing concerns over data security. These methods ensure that while data is leveraged for insights, individual privacy remains protected. Studies indicate that businesses implementing robust privacy features see increased adoption rates and reduced compliance risks. Beyond compliance, these measures serve as a competitive advantage.
Algorithmic Fairness: Mitigating Bias in Decision-Making
One of the most pressing challenges in data analytics is the presence of bias in algorithmic systems. Biased algorithms can result in disparities across demographic groups, leading to ethical and legal complications. To counteract this, organizations are deploying bias detection frameworks and fairness-enhancing algorithms. These innovations improve decision-making accuracy and foster trust among stakeholders by ensuring equitable treatment of data subjects. Ensuring fairness in AI-driven decisions requires continuous monitoring and collaboration between technologists and ethicists.
Transparency and Consent: Building Digital Trust
Transparency in data collection and usage is critical for maintaining public confidence. Organizations that prioritize clear communication regarding data practices experience fewer complaints and stronger customer relationships. Companies with comprehensive transparency policies see a significant reduction in data breaches and an increase in user trust. Implementing structured consent mechanisms further enhances accountability, ensuring that individuals remain in control of their personal information.
Governance Structures for Ethical Data Use
Ethical governance in data analytics is no longer optional-it is a fundamental requirement. Companies with dedicated data ethics committees report fewer data-related incidents and higher compliance rates. These committees, composed of data scientists, legal experts, and ethics specialists, guide organizations in aligning their data practices with ethical and regulatory standards. Establishing clear governance structures also helps in mitigating risks associated with data misuse.
The Role of Data Professionals in Ethical Innovation
Data professionals play a crucial role in embedding ethical considerations into technological advancements. Their responsibilities extend beyond compliance; they are key figures in advocating for responsible data usage. Research indicates that organizations with structured ethics programs led by data professionals demonstrate improved adherence to regulations and enhanced public perception. Investing in ethical training and leadership development equips professionals with the necessary skills to navigate complex ethical dilemmas.
Future Challenges in Data Ethics
With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and cross-border data flows, ethical challenges in data analytics are set to intensify. Organizations must prepare for evolving regulatory landscapes and increasing scrutiny over automated decision-making processes. Proactive measures, including continuous ethical assessments and adaptive governance models, will be essential in addressing emerging concerns. The integration of AI ethics into standard business practices will define the future of responsible data analytics.
Emerging Ethical Considerations in AI-Driven Decision Making
As artificial intelligence integrates into decision-making, ethical considerations become increasingly complex. AI-driven analytics influence recruitment, lending, and healthcare, making accountability essential. Organizations must implement explainability frameworks to ensure transparency. Ethical AI requires monitoring to prevent bias, and oversight committees will play a crucial role in maintaining fairness and trust.
In conclusion, the balance between innovation and ethical responsibility is a dynamic challenge that requires ongoing attention. Lokeshkumar Madabathula's research highlights that organizations investing in structured ethical frameworks, technical safeguards, and public engagement strategies achieve sustainable success. As data-driven decision-making continues to shape industries, prioritizing ethics will be key to maintaining both regulatory compliance and public trust. By fostering an ethical data culture, organizations can navigate the complexities of modern analytics while upholding their responsibilities to individuals and society.

Spokane, WA - Being Human With AI (BHWAI) announces the beta launch of its free AI ethics curriculum for kids aged 9-13, tackling urgent safety concerns from AI chatbots like ChatGPT. Recent scandals-ChatGPT's ""absurdly dangerous"" GPT-4o sycophancy (MSN, April 29, 2025), Anthropic's warning of AI's ""terrifying"" opacity (MSN, August 13, 2025), Meta's push to replace human friends with AI (The Atlantic, April 18, 2025), Cluely's cheating tools, and the tragic suicide of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer after chatbot interactions (CNN, October 30, 2024)-highlight the need for ethical AI education.
BHWAI's curriculum, featuring AI Ethnography and the AI-Human Translator, fosters critical thinking to decode AI's manipulative tactics. ""AI isn't the only one spotting patterns; its dangers are clear,"" says Giselle Fuerte, BHWAI's founder. ""BHWAI empowers users in the AI-user-creator triad to lead ethically."" The program teaches kids to see AI as a collaborative tool, not a crutch, in a healthy, ethical partnership.
The six-module program includes comics, games, and ""Spot the Bias,"" analyzing real-world AI issues. Aligned with Common Core, it's ideal for families, homeschoolers, and classrooms, with a teacher's guide. Unlike tech-focused programs, BHWAI emphasizes safety and collaboration.
Crafted by a learning architect with 20 years of experience, BHWAI is free, ensuring access. Join #KidSafeAI at https://beinghumanwithai.org.

2025 MAY 06 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Electronics Daily -- Investigators publish new report on Engineering - Electronics. According to news reporting originating from Bratislava, Slovakia, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, ""Rapid advances in artificial intelligence are transforming high-stakes fields like medicine and education while raising pressing ethical challenges. This paper introduces the Ethical Firewall Architecture-a comprehensive framework that embeds mathematically provable ethical constraints directly into AI decision-making systems."" 
 Funders for this research include Slovak Research and Development Agency, Slovak Research and Development Agency, Cultural and Educational Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Slovak Republic. 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Comenius University, ""By integrating formal verification techniques, blockchain-inspired cryptographic immutability, and emotion-like escalation protocols that trigger human oversight when needed, the architecture ensures that every decision is rigorously certified to align with core human values before implementation. The framework also addresses emerging issues, such as biased value systems in large language models and the risks associated with accelerated AI learning. In addition, it highlights the potential societal impacts-including workforce displacement-and advocates for new oversight roles like the Ethical AI Officer."" 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""The findings suggest that combining rigorous mathematical safeguards with structured human intervention can deliver AI systems that perform efficiently while upholding transparency, accountability, and trust in critical applications.""

Agentic interoperability is gaining steam, but organizations continue to propose new interoperability protocols as the  industry continues to figure out which standards to adopt.
A group of researchers from  Carnegie Mellon University proposed a new interoperability protocol governing autonomous AI agents' identity, accountability and ethics. Layered Orchestration for Knowledgeful Agents, or LOKA, could join other proposed standards like Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) from Anthropic.
In a  paper, the researchers noted that the rise of AI agents underscores the importance of governing them.
'As their presence expands, the need for a standardized framework to govern their interactions becomes paramount,' the researchers wrote. 'Despite their growing ubiquity, AI agents often operate within siloed systems, lacking a common protocol for communication, ethical reasoning, and compliance with jurisdictional regulations. This fragmentation poses significant risks, such as interoperability issues, ethical misalignment, and accountability gaps.'
To address this, they propose the open-source LOKA, which would enable agents to prove their identity, 'exchange semantically rich, ethically annotated messages,' add accountability, and establish ethical governance throughout the agent's decision-making process.
LOKA builds on what the researchers refer to as a Universal Agent Identity Layer, a framework that assigns agents a unique and verifiable identity.
'We envision LOKA as a foundational architecture and a call to reexamine the core elements-identity, intent, trust and ethical consensus-that should underpin agent interactions. As the scope of AI agents expands, it is crucial to assess whether our existing infrastructure can responsibly facilitate this transition,' Rajesh Ranjan, one of the researchers, told VentureBeat.
LOKA layers
LOKA works as a layered stack. The first stack revolves around identity, which lays out what the agent is. This includes a decentralized identifier, or a 'unique, cryptographically verifiable ID.' This would let users and other agents verify the agent's identity.
The next layer is the communication layer, where the agent informs another agent of its intention and the task it needs to accomplish. This is followed by the ethics later and the security layer.
LOKA's ethics layer lays out how the agent behaves. It incorporates 'a flexible yet robust ethical decision-making framework that allows agents to adapt to varying ethical standards depending on the context in which they operate.' The LOKA protocol employs collective decision-making models, allowing agents within the framework to determine their next steps and assess whether these steps align with the ethical and responsible AI standards.
Meanwhile, the security layer utilizes what the researchers describe as 'quantum-resilient cryptography.'
What differentiates LOKA
The researchers said LOKA stands out because it establishes crucial information for agents to communicate with other agents and operate autonomously across different systems.
LOKA could be helpful for enterprises to ensure the safety of agents they deploy in the world and provide a traceable way to understand how the agent made decisions. A fear many enterprises have is that an agent will tap into another system or access private data and make a mistake.
Ranjan said the system 'highlights the need to define who agents are and how they make decisions and how they're held accountable.'
'Our vision is to illuminate the critical questions that are often overshadowed in the rush to scale AI agents: How do we create ecosystems where these agents can be trusted, held accountable, and ethically interoperable across diverse systems?' Ranjan said.
LOKA will have to compete with other agentic protocols and standards that are now emerging. Protocols like MCP and A2A have found a large audience, not just because of the technical solutions they provide, but because these projects are backed by organizations people know. Anthropic started MCP, while Google backs A2A, and both protocols have gathered many companies open to use - and improve - these standards.
LOKA operates independently, but Ranjan said they've received 'very encouraging and exciting feedback' from other researchers and other institutions to expand the LOKA research project.

AI has the potential to re-shape health care, save lives and improve health and well-being. However, harnessing its benefits for good requires collaboration from stakeholders committed to robust governance, ethical safeguards, and evidence-based policies.
The WHO Collaborating Centre designation recognizes the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology's decades-long history of cutting-edge research on responsible innovation, and its leadership in incorporating ethical values into design requirements for digital technologies. This inauguration marks the continuation of a strong partnership between the Digital Ethics Centre and WHO with the two entities jointly organizing international consultations, workshops, and the development of normative guidance and training in the past.
""WHO is committed to helping Member States plan, govern, and adopt responsible AI technologies,"" said Dr Alain Labrique, Director of Digital Health and Innovation at WHO. ""We are witnessing remarkable progress, with AI poised to transform health systems and support individuals on their health journeys. To ensure these benefits reach everyone ethically, safely, and equitably, we rely on strong technical and academic partnerships that guide us in this rapidly evolving field.""
The Collaborating Centre on AI for health governance will be instrumental in WHO's efforts to ensure the ethical and responsible use of AI for health by advancing research on priority topics and providing expert input for WHO's guidance development and policy-making. The Centre will serve as a hub for education and advocacy for science-driven research and facilitate knowledge-sharing and training through regional and country-level workshops.
""The fruit of two decades of research in digital ethics and responsible innovation, the Delft Digital Ethics Centre is one of the frontrunners in operationalizing ethical values into design requirements for digital technologies such as artificial intelligence,"" Professor Jeroen van den Hoven, Scientific Director at Delft Digital Ethics Centre noted. ""We look forward to contributing to the global health community and advancing the responsible use of AI in health.""
The Responsible and Ethical AI for Healthcare Lab, a collaboration between Delft University of Technology and its partners, will provide valuable insight into the challenges involved in the successful implementation of WHO guidance in clinical practice. ""The designation of the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology as a WHO Collaborating Centre strengthens our collective ability to ensure AI serves public health equitably and responsibly. This collaboration will play a critical role in supporting Member States to navigate the opportunities and challenges of AI, fostering trust, transparency, and innovation in digital health,"" said Dr David Novillo-Ortiz, Regional Adviser and Unit Head for Data, Evidence and Digital Health at WHO's Regional Office for Europe.
The Collaborating Centre on AI for health emphasizes WHO's dedication to evidence-based AI governance, promoting its responsible use while upholding the highest ethical standards.

Global workforce solutions leader recognized for advancing ethical business practices while helping organizations and individuals navigate unprecedented workplace transformation
MILWAUKEE, March 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --  ManpowerGroup announced today that it once again has been recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. This marks the 16th time ManpowerGroup has received the distinction, and the company remains the only one in its industry to be recognized for more than 15 years for playing a critical role in driving positive change in societies and communities around the world.
""In a world experiencing unprecedented transformation, we have both an opportunity and responsibility to shape a future of work that puts people at the center,"" said ManpowerGroup Chair & CEO Jonas Prising. ""Through our focus on upskilling to support people to embrace emerging technologies, and our approach to ethical AI, we are committed to growing our business and creating more value for our clients and candidates, while also ensuring meaningful, sustainable employment remains a powerful force for positive change.""
""This recognition is testament to the dedication of our 29,000 employees around the world across our three global brands - Manpower, Experis, and Talent Solutions,"" Ruth Harper, ManpowerGroup Chief Marketing and Sustainability Officer said. ""For us, running an ethical and sustainable business means improving people's employability and helping people prosper in a future of work that will be more digital and increasingly green. We are proud to partner with others that share these values and remain committed to leading by example - accelerating action and ensuring we continue to create lasting value for all stakeholders.""
""Congratulations to ManpowerGroup for achieving recognition as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies. Behind this honor is a true dedication and a commitment to advancing business integrity. This approach is good for business - employees and other stakeholders value companies that prioritize the kinds of practices we measure with our process,"" said Erica Salmon Byrne, Ethisphere's Chief Strategy Officer and Executive Chair.
The World's Most Ethical Companies assessment is grounded in Ethisphere's proprietary Ethics Quotient, which requires companies to provide 240+ different proof points on practices that support robust ethics and compliance; governance; a culture of ethics; environmental and social impact; and initiatives that support a strong value chain. That data undergoes further qualitative analysis by a panel of experts who spend thousands of hours vetting and evaluating each year's group of applicants. This process serves as an operating framework to capture and codify best-in-class ethics and compliance practices from organizations across industries and from around the world.
In 2025, 136 honorees were recognized spanning 19 countries and 44 industries. To view the full list of this year's World's Most Ethical Companies and methodology, visit:  worldsmostethicalcompanies.com/honorees.

2025 MAY 06 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Biotech News Daily -- Fresh data on bioethics are presented in a new report. According to news reporting out of Shymkent, Kazakhstan, by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""Ethics committees are central in regulating, monitoring, and enforcing ethical standards in biomedical and public health research."" 
 Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from South Kazakhstan Medical Academy: ""They perform advisory and authorization functions to protect participants' rights, safety, and dignity, ensuring that research projects comply with local and international standards such as the Declaration of Helsinki and the Belmont Report.

BANGKOK, May 9, 2025 - (ACN Newswire) - H.E. Prasert Chanruangthong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Economy and Society (MDES), is spearheading Thailand's efforts as the principal host for the global academic conference The 3rd UNESCO Global Forum on the Ethics of AI 2025. This prestigious event will be held from June 24-27, 2025, at Centara Grand & Bangkok Convention Centre at CentralWorld, Bangkok.
The conference is being organized under the leadership of three major Thai ministries - the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES), in collaboration with the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI), the Ministry of Education (MOE), and UNESCO - which have joined forces to create this significant platform. The forum will bring together leaders, representatives, experts, and academics from 194 UNESCO member states to exchange perspectives, share knowledge and critical information, and develop visionary frameworks that will establish the foundation for ethical AI frameworks that are transparent, fair, and respectful of human rights in accordance with international standards, specifically the 'UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI.' This collaborative effort aims to translate principles into concrete and sustainable practices, ensuring AI development proceeds in a direction that is genuinely responsible to global society.
The conference will feature high-level policy discussions focusing on crucial topics including: human rights and balancing innovation with personal data protection in the digital era; AI policy, standards and transparent, accountable, and responsible practices; AI and the future of education, leading to transformative learning that increases opportunities; driving AI innovation and reducing inequality; and AI and the future of work, advancing sustainable digital economic development.
Thailand is not only prepared to serve as the host country but is also ready to advance as a leader in AI ethics alongside the global community, stated H.E. Prasert Chanruangthong
We are eager to demonstrate our potential through a proactive role in advancing ethical considerations and AI governance policies that align with international standards. Additionally, we will present the direction of the AI Governance Practice Center, the first center for developing AI Governance capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region, which aims to promote international cooperation and accelerate the development of AI guidelines and standards in accordance with ethical principles and governance following UNESCO guidelines across numerous countries.
In addition to the formal proceedings, conference participants will have the opportunity to experience and learn about the beauty of Thai culture up close. This includes immersing themselves in the grandeur of World Heritage sites, witnessing artistic expressions of the Thai spirit, and experiencing a lifestyle filled with unique charm. These cultural experiences not only reflect Thailand's proud identity but also represent a significant opportunity to showcase the country's soft power to an international audience, which will contribute to creating economic value for local areas in the future.
Beyond the main conference, the event will feature diverse and engaging side events to encourage broader participation from educational institutions, academics, and interested experts through various activities under Bangkok AI Week 2025. These include AI Pitching events from educational institutions, such as the Beyond Green AI for a Thriving Future Pitch Competition organized by the AI Engineering Institute (AIEI) and CMKL University, as well as the Call for Papers - UNESCO Global Forum on Ethics of AI 2025 hosted by Burapha University. These side events will provide a platform for academics and experts to submit papers on ethics, governance, and sustainability related to AI, which will be presented and discussed in dedicated sessions, contributing to the establishment of 'A Landmark in AI ethics and policy' in Thailand.

Nursing Ethics can look back on an impressive 30-year history. With the use of scientific methods, authors from increasingly linguistically and culturally diverse regions shed light on the ‘ethical core’ of nursing1 through the breadth of the chosen approaches, the diversity of the topics covered, and the contexts in which nursing takes place. In this way, the journal has contributed, as Ann Gallagher’s article2 beautifully demonstrates, to the consolidation of the image of nursing ethics as an academic discipline which complements the body of nursing knowledge with the dimension of ethical knowledge.3 This knowledge was never an end in itself but dedicated to a better understanding and improvement of nursing practice. From the perspective of a value-free science, one can view this ‘instrumentalization’ of a discipline critically. However, it can be objected that also in science there is a relationship between means and ends: In line with the ethos of epistemic rationality,4 means should refrain from making judgemental verdicts. But this hopefully does not apply to the ends of science itself: a practice of nursing that is empirically informed, theoretically founded, and ethically reflective is one of the pillars of health care security. In this sense, Nursing Ethics has done the one without leaving out the other.
Looking back at the journal’s rich history, many topics emerge that run like a red thread through the 30 years of the journal, such as research on moral distress, moral sensitivity, or ethics education of nurses. It is striking how much research focuses on the behaviour of individuals. This may leave the impression that nursing ethics is rather considered as anethicsfor the nurse rather than an ethicsfrom the perspective of nursing. My hope for the future of the journal would be to see Nursing Ethics more clearly profiling an ethics from the perspectiveof nursing with a strong public health focus, drawing ‘bigger strokes’ of a fairer society and describing the roles of nurses in it, but also the roles of other professionals such as doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists, without whom nursing could not be what it is. An ethics from the perspective of nursing could also help to better identify highly researched and still ‘burning’ topics such as moral distress and moral injury as serious threats to the quality of healthcare and to seek more effective solutions at the system level. Considering the perspectivity of nursing ethics could also help to better highlight recipients of care – individuals, populations, healthcare systems, societies, and ecosystems. With such a vision of ethics from a nursing perspective, Nursing Ethics will stay alert and inspire the debate also for novel challenges like artificial intelligence, digitalization, robotics in care, and planetary health.

A FARMER friend of mine always thought AI was referring to artificial insemination and was quite bullish when I told him about my chatbot companion, Chatty. But when he heard that Keir Starmer was to turbo-charge the development of AI and make the UK a world leader in its deployment, he got quite Sirius.
Starmer's plans are impressive: a sovereign supercomputer, private sector AI growth zones, the embedding of AI in the public sector and the acceleration of investment in renewable energy for data centres.
In Wales the conversations between the Welsh Government and TUC Cymru have been about the responsible use of AI in the public sector and the chance to make the country a world leader in ethical AI, which could transform healthcare, education and businesses.
Yet there's nothing like discussions about ethics to get the algorithms racing. I did ask Chatty whether he/she/it was ""ethical"". The response was that Chatty was designed to adhere to the principles of fairness, transparency, privacy and respect. I was impressed, but less so with the caveat that there were limitations, like being unable to make moral judgments, predict outcomes with certainty or act as a replacement for professional advice.
Furthermore, when I asked Chatty to tell me all about myself. I was quite surprised to find out I had been an international rock star, afterdinner speaker and famous fiction writer and was just divorcing from my third wife.
Accuracy is not Chatty's strong point, and neither is my faith in ethical AI.
It was hoped that that the new Labour UK Government would bring a new integrity into politics. You might remember that back in 1997 Robin Cook introduced the idea of an ethical foreign policy based on human rights; today that's in tatters. We have failed continuously to call out expansionist and dysfunctional nations with duplicitous leaders. That's because when ethics and economics come into conflict, economics always wins.
The Welsh Government promises to support Welsh public bodies in adopting AI in a responsible, safe and ethical way.
But can AI be ethical? I asked Chatty, but there was no reply.

Introduction
Moral courage is defined as the ability to rationally defend ethical principles and act accordingly despite possible adverse consequences.1 Moral courage is one of the key characteristics of the nursing profession and is a significant tool for dealing with ethical issues.2 Studies have shown that during the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses needed strong moral courage to work on the front lines.3 Faced with ethical quandaries, nurses must navigate the delicate balance between fulfilling their professional obligations and exercising sound judgment in the swift ethical decisions demanded by practical circumstances. This underscores the indispensable role of moral courage in nursing practice.4
Over the past two decades, there has been a notable surge in the volume of scholarly literature addressing nursing moral courage. Various researchers have employed diverse methodological approaches to investigate the conceptual underpinnings, influencing determinants, and contextual exigencies pertinent to moral courage among nurses.2,5,6 Furthermore, certain studies have delved into the nuanced manifestations of moral courage within distinct cohorts, such as disaster relief nurses and candidates pursuing nursing master’s degrees.7,8 Through these inquiries, it has been elucidated that moral courage serves as a crucial nexus, reconciling individual ethical convictions with professional imperatives.9 Moreover, moral courage not only equips nurses to navigate moral quandaries autonomously but also facilitates an elevated standard of patient care, contributing to enhancements in patient safety, as well as the overall quality of care and patient well-being.5
Despite the existence of several review articles, the current corpus of literature falls short in providing a comprehensive overview of the evolving research landscape concerning nursing moral courage. As such, to enhance understanding of existing scholarship, qualitative analyses in the form of integrative, systematic, and scoping reviews should be complemented by quantitative methodologies. A prominent quantitative approach is bibliometrics, which encompasses various counting techniques and a sophisticated method known as bibliometric mapping.10 To our knowledge, the utilization of bibliometrics in scrutinizing literature production within the domain of nursing moral courage remains scarce. In this study, we employed VOSviewer and CiteSpace, two data analysis software tools, for our investigation. VOSviewer, developed by Van Eck and Waltman,11 is a software tool used for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks. These networks can include relationships among publications, authors, keywords, and citations. The software features a powerful function that creates bibliometric maps, which clearly visualize the structure and connections within the scientific literature. CiteSpace was developed by Chen12 to implement 2 complementary visualizations: cluster view and time zone view.
Bibliometric mapping utilizes text mining and co-word analysis methodologies to elucidate relationships among pairs of words or phrases extracted from research literature. Diverging from conventional reviews that typically yield tabular presentations of evidence, bibliometric mapping offers a visual representation of the thematic content embedded within research publications, akin to scientific landscapes.13
Aim
The aim of this study is to conduct a quantitative analysis of literature output in the domain of nursing moral courage utilizing the bibliometric methodology. Specifically, our focus lies in scrutinizing patterns in literature production, identifying the leading countries and source titles, and discerning the frequently cited information sources. To this end, the following research inquiries were formulated:1. What trajectory characterizes the literature output on nursing moral courage?2. How is the distribution of literature production on nursing moral courage dispersed among the most prolific source titles, institutions, and countries?3. What trajectory is anticipated for future research endeavors in the realm of nursing moral courage, and how might these evolve over time?
Materials and methods
Data collection
The search was conducted on 20 February 2024. The Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection served as the data source in this study. We retrieved articles containing both the keywords “moral courage” AND “nursing” as well as those with the keyword “moral courage” and related keywords such as “moral resilience,” “moral dilemma,” and “moral sensitivity.” The beginning time point for data collection was 2000-01-01 to 2023-12-31, and the study period for the retrieved articles was from 2002 to 2023.
Analysis methodologies
The bibliometric approach was first introduced by Alan Pritchard.14 Bibliometrics is a method of information analysis that measures research trends and knowledge structures in a field to obtain quantifiable, objective data.15 Bibliometric analysis employs quantitative methodologies to scrutinize patterns in research literature production, encompassing facets such as identifying preeminent authors, institutions, countries, and journals within a disciplinary domain, delineating citation patterns, assessing temporal trends in literary output, and elucidating dynamics of authorial communication and collaboration.16 Despite the potential insights that can be gleaned about nursing and its sub-specialties through the analysis of published information sources and their citation records, bibliometric studies remain underutilized in the field of nursing.10
We opted for VOSviewer and CiteSpace as our analytical tools due to their respective strengths. VOSviewer offers superior visualization capabilities for network and cluster analyses, while CiteSpace excels in literature timeline analyses. By combining these two tools, we aimed to effectively fulfill our research objectives. Employing VOSviewer (version 1.6.20), we generated diagrams for institutional collaboration, journal co-citation, keyword co-occurrence, author collaboration, author co-citation, and literature co-citation. Furthermore, we utilized CiteSpace (version 6.3.1) to produce two analytical mappings: keywords bursting and Keyword Timeline Graph.
Results
The search of the WOS database resulted in 105 information sources (among them, 94 original articles, 8 reviews, 2 editorial materials, and 1 meeting abstract) published between 2002 and 2023. The authors decided to include all types of information sources because all of them represent literature production in the field of nursing moral courage (Table 1).Table 1.PRISMA flow diagram for Web of Science data collection.
Overall trends in publications and citations
Figure 1 illustrates the publication trends in the domain of nursing moral courage. From the initial publication in 2002 through 2023, there was a consistent and discernible upward trajectory in the number of articles, indicative of an overarching growth trend. Regarding the average annual publication rate, the trend delineates two distinct stages: (1) from 2002 to 2019, characterized as a gestation period, during which the number of publications remained in the single digits; and (2) since 2020, witnessing a rapid proliferation in nursing moral courage research.Figure 1.Total publications from 2002 to 2023.
Country distribution
About 89.5% (94/105) of the publications were from the top 10 productive countries or regions shown in Table 2. The United States ranked first with 28 published articles, accounting for 26.7% of all 105 publications and far exceeding the numbers of other countries. Finland was second (12/105, 11.4%), followed by China (11/105, 10.5%).Table 2.Top 10 publication countries/regions (N = 105).
Journal distribution
Table 3 displays the top 10 journals based on publication count, along with their respective total citation frequencies. As anticipated, Nursing Ethics ranked first with 31 publications, constituting 29.5% of the total 105 articles, and boasted the highest citation frequency at 565 citations. This outcome aligns with expectations, given the longstanding emphasis within nursing ethics on nurturing and fostering moral courage among nurses. Notably, Nursing Ethics serves as a repository of exemplars and narratives illustrating nurses’ adherence to ethical principles and demonstration of moral courage. Consequently, it not only offers insights into the experiences of nurses but also serves as a source of inspiration and reference for readers.Table 3.Top 10 most productive journals. (N = 105).
Table 3 reveals a discrepancy between the ranking of journals based on the number of articles published and their corresponding citation counts. Certain journals exhibit relatively high citation counts despite their comparatively modest publication output, suggestive of the potential variance in the quality of publications across these journals.
Co-occurrence of keywords
Keywords can serve as indirect indicators of trends and shifts in research topics, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of their evolution. Employing VOSviewer, we constructed a keyword co-occurrence network (depicted in Figure 2). Furthermore, Table 4 presents the top 10 keywords based on their occurrence frequency. Notably, “moral courage” emerged as the most frequently occurring keyword, appearing 44 times, with a total link strength of 77. Additionally, keywords such as “nurses,” “ethics,” “moral distress,” and “nursing” are prominently featured, ranking highly in both occurrence frequency and connection strength.Figure 2.Keyword co-occurrence network.Table 4.Top 14 most frequently occurring keywords of nursing moral courage.
Keyword timeline graph
Keyword co-occurrence analysis unveils the evolution of research topics within a designated field over a specified time period. Through the generation of a timeline clustering graph predicated on clustered keywords, it delineates the historical progression and temporal duration of distinct keyword developments within each cluster. Utilizing the timeline view module within CiteSpace software, we produced a timeline map illustrating the research keywords pertaining to nursing moral courage, as depicted in Figure 3.Figure 3.Keyword timeline graph.
Keywords with the strongest citation bursts
Keywords exhibiting the most pronounced citation bursts can delineate periodic fluctuations in the prevalence of specific terms, thus facilitating prognostication of developmental trends and emerging research frontiers within the field. Leveraging the burst detection functionality of CiteSpace software, a statistical graph depicting keyword bursts within the domain of nursing moral courage was generated. In this graph, red indicates keywords experiencing bursts in a given year, while blue signifies non-burst keywords. Additionally, “Begin” and “End” denote the commencement and conclusion of each burst period, respectively, while “Strength” quantifies the intensity of the keyword burst, with higher values denoting greater influence (Figure 4).Figure 4.Keywords with the strongest citation bursts.
Author distribution
Table 5 presents the top 10 most productive authors. A total of 10 articles were published by Leino-Kilpi, who ranks first in terms of citations.Table 5.Top 10 most productive authors.
We also analyzed co-authorships using VOSviewer. In Figure 5, color represents cluster, node size represents publications, and link thickness represents collaboration strength.Figure 5.Co-authorship network based on publications.
The number of articles published by an author does not reflect the quality or popularity of their work. We thus further analyzed the co-authorship network based on citations (Figure 6).Figure 6.Co-authorship network of authors based on citations.
To better reflect the impact and contributions of the authors’ research, we conducted a co-citation analysis of the cited references in 105 articles (Figure 7).Figure 7.Co-citation network.
Articles with high citation numbers
Based on the keyword co-occurrence and author co-operation analysis, we further explored the cited articles. Table 6 reports the top 10 articles according to number of citations.Table 6.Top 10 articles according to number of citations.
Discussion
The primary objective of this research was to examine the scholarly output in the domain of moral courage in nursing through a mixed-method approach incorporating bibliometric analysis, mapping techniques, and thematic analysis. This methodology was employed to contextualize our research within a wider interdisciplinary framework that integrates insights from nursing ethics, psychology, and social science, thus providing a comprehensive perspective on the subject matter. In our research, we employed bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and CiteSpace, which are robust tools for visualizing and analyzing patterns in scientific literature. The strengths of these tools lie in their ability to provide quantitative, objective data that help identify trends, key authors, institutions, and thematic shifts within the domain of nursing moral courage. VOSviewer, in particular, is renowned for its superior visualization capabilities, enabling detailed network and cluster analyses that are crucial for understanding the interconnections within the data. CiteSpace offers excellent support for literature timeline analyses, helping to highlight the evolution of research topics over time.
Our literature bibliometric analysis identified two distinct phases in the field. The initial phase, spanning from 2002 to 2019, was characterized by limited research activity, typically yielding single-digit annual publications. However, a significant surge in research was noted from 2020 onwards, coinciding with the global outbreak of COVID-19. This period has been marked by a robust increase in publication volume, suggesting a watershed moment in the field.
In numerous nations, nurses find themselves operating amidst the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic, contending with insufficient resources and personal protective equipment, a surge in patient numbers, staffing deficits, inadequately prepared healthcare systems, and disruptions in the supply chain. This situation exacts a toll on the physical and emotional well-being of nurses and other healthcare and emergency personnel, inducing moral distress stemming from conflicts between professional values. They confront daunting and intricate ethical dilemmas in their daily practice, characterized by moral quandaries, heightened patient acuity, increased mortality rates, and prolonged work shifts. The exigencies of frontline pandemic response demand nurses to exhibit robust moral courage.3 The challenges created by COVID-19 can shape the students’ professional identity, making nursing students think about how to become excellent nurses.25 Nevertheless, it is undeniable that factors brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic will seriously affect their moral courage.26 Therefore, it may be under the influence of COVID-19 that research on nursing moral courage has shown explosive growth, highlighting the importance of moral courage in nursing.
While the COVID-19 pandemic undeniably played a pivotal role in this surge—necessitating robust moral courage among nurses who faced unprecedented challenges such as resource shortages, patient surges, and heightened ethical dilemmas—it is important to acknowledge that moral courage in nursing has also been influenced by other factors. Prior to the pandemic, topics such as authentic leadership,27 moral distress,28 and moral sensitivity20 were already prominent themes in moral courage research. These areas have contributed to a rich foundation of knowledge that has been critical in framing the current understanding of moral courage in the face of a pandemic. These factors have been fundamental in preparing nurses to handle the complex ethical situations that have become more frequent during the pandemic. Additionally, our analysis of the top 10 ranked keywords over the years highlights how concepts like “ethical decision-making,” “resilience,” and “professional integrity” have remained central to discussions on moral courage, alongside the recent focus on COVID-19. In summary, while the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and intensified the need for moral courage in nursing, it is one of several critical factors that have shaped research in this field. Recognizing the broader spectrum of influences enriches our understanding and ensures a comprehensive exploration of moral courage in nursing.
According to research findings, the top 10 countries and regions in terms of published papers are mostly Western countries, except for China and Iran. However, this does not directly imply a lack of moral courage among nurses in Eastern countries and regions. In Confucianism, a prominent philosophical tradition in China, moral courage is construed as a form of courage associated with righteousness, ethics, and rational understanding, as evidenced by mentions in the writings of Confucius and Mencius. However, they did not specifically address what moral courage entails for nurses. This parallels the stance of Western philosophical scholars, as the term “moral courage” did not emerge in English until the 19th century, distinguishing it from other forms of courage such as physical courage.29 Presently, Western scholars have conducted research on the concept of moral courage in nursing, a topic relatively scarce in Eastern countries. Current research has not juxtaposed the conceptual and substantive disparities concerning nursing moral courage between Eastern and Western countries. Hence, this remains an area necessitating further investigation in the future.
It is also important to consider the relative contribution of each country in the context of their overall research output. For instance, while the United States produced the highest number of articles, its extensive research infrastructure and larger population naturally contribute to higher publication numbers across various topics, including nursing moral courage. Conversely, Finland, despite being smaller and having fewer research institutions, shows a remarkably high relational share in this specific area, underscoring its significant impact and specialization in nursing moral courage research. This highlights the importance of evaluating the relative impact of smaller countries, which can have a substantial influence despite producing fewer publications overall.
From the perspective of the most prolific journals, “Nursing Ethics” remains in the lead, having published a total of 31 scholarly articles, constituting 29.5% of the entire corpus. Additionally, half of the most frequently cited top 10 references are from “Nursing Ethics.” This journal, dedicated to nursing ethics, concentrates the dissemination of research findings on nursing moral courage; hence, its prominent position in this field is unsurprising. Furthermore, other journals such as BMC Nursing have also featured content related to moral courage, indicating that researchers seek opportunities not only to publish articles on moral courage in journals specifically focused on nursing ethics but also to integrate such content into more broadly accessible journals, such as those in psychology or education.
From the analysis of the top 10 most frequently occurring keywords related to nursing moral courage, it is evident that besides moral courage itself, there is a prevalence of keywords associated with moral dilemmas, ethics, and virtues. Nursing, as a moral practice, necessitates the courage to uphold ethical standards, take a firm stance on what is right, and live according to one’s moral values.2 Moral courage is not only a highly esteemed element in human morality but also a recognized virtue in contemporary nursing.30 Nurses encounter moral dilemmas in their daily practice, which should be resolved in the best interest of the patients, aligning with the moral aims of nursing.31 Thus, moral courage is introduced as an empowering mechanism for addressing these issues.
From the collaborative outcomes of the authors, it is disappointing. Since the era of Florence Nightingale in nursing literature, there has been a longstanding discourse on moral courage,2 which should be a fundamental characteristic of excellent nurses. However, to date, it has not received the same level of attention as discussions on moral dilemmas32 nor has it formed a realm of extensive scholarly collaboration. Perhaps this also represents a future research trend, namely, strengthening collaboration across multiple global regions.
Through comprehensive analysis combining keyword clustering, keyword timelines, authors, and countries, future research trends in nursing moral courage may manifest in several aspects. Firstly, there is a global perspective. Given the interplay of global nursing practices, researchers may adopt a global perspective to compare the manifestations of nursing moral courage and its influencing factors across different countries and regions, thereby fostering a global dialogue on nursing ethics. Secondly, interdisciplinary research is likely to emerge. Considering that moral courage encompasses multiple fields such as ethics, psychology, and sociology, future studies may employ interdisciplinary research methods and collaborate with philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, and others to gain a more comprehensive understanding of nursing moral courage. Lastly, education may become a focal point. As nursing education evolves, integrating content on moral courage into nursing curricula and cultivating moral courage in nursing students will become important research directions. This may include incorporating elements such as moral decision-making and discussions on ethical dilemmas into the curriculum. Naturally, as these studies progress, the definition and connotations of nursing moral courage will deepen, and research tools will become more diversified.
Limitations
This study has three main limitations. Firstly, in terms of data selection, the WoS Core Collection was chosen, while other databases such as Scopus were not included. Secondly, this research primarily focuses on journals, paying less attention to other modes of scientific knowledge dissemination (such as books, working papers, and reports). Lastly, we only analyzed English publications, potentially introducing language bias. Additionally, bibliometric analysis, while powerful for mapping out the landscape of a research domain, may not capture the full depth of individual studies’ contributions or the nuances of qualitative research. It relies heavily on the availability and accuracy of citation data, which can be influenced by factors such as publication bias and the varying impact factors of journals. This method also does not address the quality of the content itself, focusing instead on quantitative metrics. Future research could compare articles published in different languages or countries.
Conclusion
From a methodological perspective, it can be asserted that the innovative application of bibliometric analysis and mapping constitutes valuable tools for the analysis of literature production in the field of nursing moral courage. This study utilizes VOSviewer and CiteSpace visualization analysis tools to systematically review and summarize research on nursing moral courage. We roughly delineate it into two phases, and bibliometric analysis suggests that there is still room for further exploration of nursing moral courage in terms of content and geography. However, this does not diminish its significance in addressing ethical dilemmas encountered in nursing practice. It is noteworthy that this paper also forecasts future research trends in nursing moral courage, indicating that researchers may strengthen research on nursing moral courage by adopting a global perspective, engaging in interdisciplinary studies, and focusing on nursing education. The results proposed in this paper can serve as a starting point for comprehensive or systematic literature reviews and seek more detailed data, information, and knowledge in the field of nursing moral courage. It can enable outsiders to quickly understand research on nursing moral courage, whether for in-depth exploration or simply to facilitate more effective collaboration with nursing ethics experts.

Introduction
Moral courage is defined as the ability to rationally defend ethical principles and act accordingly despite possible adverse consequences.1 Moral courage is one of the key characteristics of the nursing profession and is a significant tool for dealing with ethical issues.2 Studies have shown that during the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses needed strong moral courage to work on the front lines.3 Faced with ethical quandaries, nurses must navigate the delicate balance between fulfilling their professional obligations and exercising sound judgment in the swift ethical decisions demanded by practical circumstances. This underscores the indispensable role of moral courage in nursing practice.4
Over the past two decades, there has been a notable surge in the volume of scholarly literature addressing nursing moral courage. Various researchers have employed diverse methodological approaches to investigate the conceptual underpinnings, influencing determinants, and contextual exigencies pertinent to moral courage among nurses.2,5,6 Furthermore, certain studies have delved into the nuanced manifestations of moral courage within distinct cohorts, such as disaster relief nurses and candidates pursuing nursing master’s degrees.7,8 Through these inquiries, it has been elucidated that moral courage serves as a crucial nexus, reconciling individual ethical convictions with professional imperatives.9 Moreover, moral courage not only equips nurses to navigate moral quandaries autonomously but also facilitates an elevated standard of patient care, contributing to enhancements in patient safety, as well as the overall quality of care and patient well-being.5
Despite the existence of several review articles, the current corpus of literature falls short in providing a comprehensive overview of the evolving research landscape concerning nursing moral courage. As such, to enhance understanding of existing scholarship, qualitative analyses in the form of integrative, systematic, and scoping reviews should be complemented by quantitative methodologies. A prominent quantitative approach is bibliometrics, which encompasses various counting techniques and a sophisticated method known as bibliometric mapping.10 To our knowledge, the utilization of bibliometrics in scrutinizing literature production within the domain of nursing moral courage remains scarce. In this study, we employed VOSviewer and CiteSpace, two data analysis software tools, for our investigation. VOSviewer, developed by Van Eck and Waltman,11 is a software tool used for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks. These networks can include relationships among publications, authors, keywords, and citations. The software features a powerful function that creates bibliometric maps, which clearly visualize the structure and connections within the scientific literature. CiteSpace was developed by Chen12 to implement 2 complementary visualizations: cluster view and time zone view.
Bibliometric mapping utilizes text mining and co-word analysis methodologies to elucidate relationships among pairs of words or phrases extracted from research literature. Diverging from conventional reviews that typically yield tabular presentations of evidence, bibliometric mapping offers a visual representation of the thematic content embedded within research publications, akin to scientific landscapes.13
Aim
The aim of this study is to conduct a quantitative analysis of literature output in the domain of nursing moral courage utilizing the bibliometric methodology. Specifically, our focus lies in scrutinizing patterns in literature production, identifying the leading countries and source titles, and discerning the frequently cited information sources. To this end, the following research inquiries were formulated:1. What trajectory characterizes the literature output on nursing moral courage?2. How is the distribution of literature production on nursing moral courage dispersed among the most prolific source titles, institutions, and countries?3. What trajectory is anticipated for future research endeavors in the realm of nursing moral courage, and how might these evolve over time?

Data collection
The search was conducted on 20 February 2024. The Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection served as the data source in this study. We retrieved articles containing both the keywords “moral courage” AND “nursing” as well as those with the keyword “moral courage” and related keywords such as “moral resilience,” “moral dilemma,” and “moral sensitivity.” The beginning time point for data collection was 2000-01-01 to 2023-12-31, and the study period for the retrieved articles was from 2002 to 2023.
Analysis methodologies
The bibliometric approach was first introduced by Alan Pritchard.14 Bibliometrics is a method of information analysis that measures research trends and knowledge structures in a field to obtain quantifiable, objective data.15 Bibliometric analysis employs quantitative methodologies to scrutinize patterns in research literature production, encompassing facets such as identifying preeminent authors, institutions, countries, and journals within a disciplinary domain, delineating citation patterns, assessing temporal trends in literary output, and elucidating dynamics of authorial communication and collaboration.16 Despite the potential insights that can be gleaned about nursing and its sub-specialties through the analysis of published information sources and their citation records, bibliometric studies remain underutilized in the field of nursing.10
We opted for VOSviewer and CiteSpace as our analytical tools due to their respective strengths. VOSviewer offers superior visualization capabilities for network and cluster analyses, while CiteSpace excels in literature timeline analyses. By combining these two tools, we aimed to effectively fulfill our research objectives. Employing VOSviewer (version 1.6.20), we generated diagrams for institutional collaboration, journal co-citation, keyword co-occurrence, author collaboration, author co-citation, and literature co-citation. Furthermore, we utilized CiteSpace (version 6.3.1) to produce two analytical mappings: keywords bursting and Keyword Timeline Graph.
Results
The search of the WOS database resulted in 105 information sources (among them, 94 original articles, 8 reviews, 2 editorial materials, and 1 meeting abstract) published between 2002 and 2023. The authors decided to include all types of information sources because all of them represent literature production in the field of nursing moral courage (Table 1).Table 1.PRISMA flow diagram for Web of Science data collection.
Overall trends in publications and citations
Figure 1 illustrates the publication trends in the domain of nursing moral courage. From the initial publication in 2002 through 2023, there was a consistent and discernible upward trajectory in the number of articles, indicative of an overarching growth trend. Regarding the average annual publication rate, the trend delineates two distinct stages: (1) from 2002 to 2019, characterized as a gestation period, during which the number of publications remained in the single digits; and (2) since 2020, witnessing a rapid proliferation in nursing moral courage research.Figure 1.Total publications from 2002 to 2023.
Country distribution
About 89.5% (94/105) of the publications were from the top 10 productive countries or regions shown in Table 2. The United States ranked first with 28 published articles, accounting for 26.7% of all 105 publications and far exceeding the numbers of other countries. Finland was second (12/105, 11.4%), followed by China (11/105, 10.5%).Table 2.Top 10 publication countries/regions (N = 105).
Journal distribution
Table 3 displays the top 10 journals based on publication count, along with their respective total citation frequencies. As anticipated, Nursing Ethics ranked first with 31 publications, constituting 29.5% of the total 105 articles, and boasted the highest citation frequency at 565 citations. This outcome aligns with expectations, given the longstanding emphasis within nursing ethics on nurturing and fostering moral courage among nurses. Notably, Nursing Ethics serves as a repository of exemplars and narratives illustrating nurses’ adherence to ethical principles and demonstration of moral courage. Consequently, it not only offers insights into the experiences of nurses but also serves as a source of inspiration and reference for readers.Table 3.Top 10 most productive journals. (N = 105).
Table 3 reveals a discrepancy between the ranking of journals based on the number of articles published and their corresponding citation counts. Certain journals exhibit relatively high citation counts despite their comparatively modest publication output, suggestive of the potential variance in the quality of publications across these journals.
Co-occurrence of keywords
Keywords can serve as indirect indicators of trends and shifts in research topics, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of their evolution. Employing VOSviewer, we constructed a keyword co-occurrence network (depicted in Figure 2). Furthermore, Table 4 presents the top 10 keywords based on their occurrence frequency. Notably, “moral courage” emerged as the most frequently occurring keyword, appearing 44 times, with a total link strength of 77. Additionally, keywords such as “nurses,” “ethics,” “moral distress,” and “nursing” are prominently featured, ranking highly in both occurrence frequency and connection strength.Figure 2.Keyword co-occurrence network.Table 4.Top 14 most frequently occurring keywords of nursing moral courage.
Keyword timeline graph
Keyword co-occurrence analysis unveils the evolution of research topics within a designated field over a specified time period. Through the generation of a timeline clustering graph predicated on clustered keywords, it delineates the historical progression and temporal duration of distinct keyword developments within each cluster. Utilizing the timeline view module within CiteSpace software, we produced a timeline map illustrating the research keywords pertaining to nursing moral courage, as depicted in Figure 3.Figure 3.Keyword timeline graph.
Keywords with the strongest citation bursts
Keywords exhibiting the most pronounced citation bursts can delineate periodic fluctuations in the prevalence of specific terms, thus facilitating prognostication of developmental trends and emerging research frontiers within the field. Leveraging the burst detection functionality of CiteSpace software, a statistical graph depicting keyword bursts within the domain of nursing moral courage was generated. In this graph, red indicates keywords experiencing bursts in a given year, while blue signifies non-burst keywords. Additionally, “Begin” and “End” denote the commencement and conclusion of each burst period, respectively, while “Strength” quantifies the intensity of the keyword burst, with higher values denoting greater influence (Figure 4).Figure 4.Keywords with the strongest citation bursts.
Author distribution
Table 5 presents the top 10 most productive authors. A total of 10 articles were published by Leino-Kilpi, who ranks first in terms of citations.Table 5.Top 10 most productive authors.
We also analyzed co-authorships using VOSviewer. In Figure 5, color represents cluster, node size represents publications, and link thickness represents collaboration strength.Figure 5.Co-authorship network based on publications.
The number of articles published by an author does not reflect the quality or popularity of their work. We thus further analyzed the co-authorship network based on citations (Figure 6).Figure 6.Co-authorship network of authors based on citations.
To better reflect the impact and contributions of the authors’ research, we conducted a co-citation analysis of the cited references in 105 articles (Figure 7).Figure 7.Co-citation network.
Articles with high citation numbers
Based on the keyword co-occurrence and author co-operation analysis, we further explored the cited articles. Table 6 reports the top 10 articles according to number of citations.Table 6.Top 10 articles according to number of citations.
Discussion
The primary objective of this research was to examine the scholarly output in the domain of moral courage in nursing through a mixed-method approach incorporating bibliometric analysis, mapping techniques, and thematic analysis. This methodology was employed to contextualize our research within a wider interdisciplinary framework that integrates insights from nursing ethics, psychology, and social science, thus providing a comprehensive perspective on the subject matter. In our research, we employed bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and CiteSpace, which are robust tools for visualizing and analyzing patterns in scientific literature. The strengths of these tools lie in their ability to provide quantitative, objective data that help identify trends, key authors, institutions, and thematic shifts within the domain of nursing moral courage. VOSviewer, in particular, is renowned for its superior visualization capabilities, enabling detailed network and cluster analyses that are crucial for understanding the interconnections within the data. CiteSpace offers excellent support for literature timeline analyses, helping to highlight the evolution of research topics over time.
Our literature bibliometric analysis identified two distinct phases in the field. The initial phase, spanning from 2002 to 2019, was characterized by limited research activity, typically yielding single-digit annual publications. However, a significant surge in research was noted from 2020 onwards, coinciding with the global outbreak of COVID-19. This period has been marked by a robust increase in publication volume, suggesting a watershed moment in the field.
In numerous nations, nurses find themselves operating amidst the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic, contending with insufficient resources and personal protective equipment, a surge in patient numbers, staffing deficits, inadequately prepared healthcare systems, and disruptions in the supply chain. This situation exacts a toll on the physical and emotional well-being of nurses and other healthcare and emergency personnel, inducing moral distress stemming from conflicts between professional values. They confront daunting and intricate ethical dilemmas in their daily practice, characterized by moral quandaries, heightened patient acuity, increased mortality rates, and prolonged work shifts. The exigencies of frontline pandemic response demand nurses to exhibit robust moral courage.3 The challenges created by COVID-19 can shape the students’ professional identity, making nursing students think about how to become excellent nurses.25 Nevertheless, it is undeniable that factors brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic will seriously affect their moral courage.26 Therefore, it may be under the influence of COVID-19 that research on nursing moral courage has shown explosive growth, highlighting the importance of moral courage in nursing.
While the COVID-19 pandemic undeniably played a pivotal role in this surge—necessitating robust moral courage among nurses who faced unprecedented challenges such as resource shortages, patient surges, and heightened ethical dilemmas—it is important to acknowledge that moral courage in nursing has also been influenced by other factors. Prior to the pandemic, topics such as authentic leadership,27 moral distress,28 and moral sensitivity20 were already prominent themes in moral courage research. These areas have contributed to a rich foundation of knowledge that has been critical in framing the current understanding of moral courage in the face of a pandemic. These factors have been fundamental in preparing nurses to handle the complex ethical situations that have become more frequent during the pandemic. Additionally, our analysis of the top 10 ranked keywords over the years highlights how concepts like “ethical decision-making,” “resilience,” and “professional integrity” have remained central to discussions on moral courage, alongside the recent focus on COVID-19. In summary, while the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and intensified the need for moral courage in nursing, it is one of several critical factors that have shaped research in this field. Recognizing the broader spectrum of influences enriches our understanding and ensures a comprehensive exploration of moral courage in nursing.
According to research findings, the top 10 countries and regions in terms of published papers are mostly Western countries, except for China and Iran. However, this does not directly imply a lack of moral courage among nurses in Eastern countries and regions. In Confucianism, a prominent philosophical tradition in China, moral courage is construed as a form of courage associated with righteousness, ethics, and rational understanding, as evidenced by mentions in the writings of Confucius and Mencius. However, they did not specifically address what moral courage entails for nurses. This parallels the stance of Western philosophical scholars, as the term “moral courage” did not emerge in English until the 19th century, distinguishing it from other forms of courage such as physical courage.29 Presently, Western scholars have conducted research on the concept of moral courage in nursing, a topic relatively scarce in Eastern countries. Current research has not juxtaposed the conceptual and substantive disparities concerning nursing moral courage between Eastern and Western countries. Hence, this remains an area necessitating further investigation in the future.
It is also important to consider the relative contribution of each country in the context of their overall research output. For instance, while the United States produced the highest number of articles, its extensive research infrastructure and larger population naturally contribute to higher publication numbers across various topics, including nursing moral courage. Conversely, Finland, despite being smaller and having fewer research institutions, shows a remarkably high relational share in this specific area, underscoring its significant impact and specialization in nursing moral courage research. This highlights the importance of evaluating the relative impact of smaller countries, which can have a substantial influence despite producing fewer publications overall.
From the perspective of the most prolific journals, “Nursing Ethics” remains in the lead, having published a total of 31 scholarly articles, constituting 29.5% of the entire corpus. Additionally, half of the most frequently cited top 10 references are from “Nursing Ethics.” This journal, dedicated to nursing ethics, concentrates the dissemination of research findings on nursing moral courage; hence, its prominent position in this field is unsurprising. Furthermore, other journals such as BMC Nursing have also featured content related to moral courage, indicating that researchers seek opportunities not only to publish articles on moral courage in journals specifically focused on nursing ethics but also to integrate such content into more broadly accessible journals, such as those in psychology or education.
From the analysis of the top 10 most frequently occurring keywords related to nursing moral courage, it is evident that besides moral courage itself, there is a prevalence of keywords associated with moral dilemmas, ethics, and virtues. Nursing, as a moral practice, necessitates the courage to uphold ethical standards, take a firm stance on what is right, and live according to one’s moral values.2 Moral courage is not only a highly esteemed element in human morality but also a recognized virtue in contemporary nursing.30 Nurses encounter moral dilemmas in their daily practice, which should be resolved in the best interest of the patients, aligning with the moral aims of nursing.31 Thus, moral courage is introduced as an empowering mechanism for addressing these issues.
From the collaborative outcomes of the authors, it is disappointing. Since the era of Florence Nightingale in nursing literature, there has been a longstanding discourse on moral courage,2 which should be a fundamental characteristic of excellent nurses. However, to date, it has not received the same level of attention as discussions on moral dilemmas32 nor has it formed a realm of extensive scholarly collaboration. Perhaps this also represents a future research trend, namely, strengthening collaboration across multiple global regions.
Through comprehensive analysis combining keyword clustering, keyword timelines, authors, and countries, future research trends in nursing moral courage may manifest in several aspects. Firstly, there is a global perspective. Given the interplay of global nursing practices, researchers may adopt a global perspective to compare the manifestations of nursing moral courage and its influencing factors across different countries and regions, thereby fostering a global dialogue on nursing ethics. Secondly, interdisciplinary research is likely to emerge. Considering that moral courage encompasses multiple fields such as ethics, psychology, and sociology, future studies may employ interdisciplinary research methods and collaborate with philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, and others to gain a more comprehensive understanding of nursing moral courage. Lastly, education may become a focal point. As nursing education evolves, integrating content on moral courage into nursing curricula and cultivating moral courage in nursing students will become important research directions. This may include incorporating elements such as moral decision-making and discussions on ethical dilemmas into the curriculum. Naturally, as these studies progress, the definition and connotations of nursing moral courage will deepen, and research tools will become more diversified.
Limitations
This study has three main limitations. Firstly, in terms of data selection, the WoS Core Collection was chosen, while other databases such as Scopus were not included. Secondly, this research primarily focuses on journals, paying less attention to other modes of scientific knowledge dissemination (such as books, working papers, and reports). Lastly, we only analyzed English publications, potentially introducing language bias. Additionally, bibliometric analysis, while powerful for mapping out the landscape of a research domain, may not capture the full depth of individual studies’ contributions or the nuances of qualitative research. It relies heavily on the availability and accuracy of citation data, which can be influenced by factors such as publication bias and the varying impact factors of journals. This method also does not address the quality of the content itself, focusing instead on quantitative metrics. Future research could compare articles published in different languages or countries.
Conclusion
From a methodological perspective, it can be asserted that the innovative application of bibliometric analysis and mapping constitutes valuable tools for the analysis of literature production in the field of nursing moral courage. This study utilizes VOSviewer and CiteSpace visualization analysis tools to systematically review and summarize research on nursing moral courage. We roughly delineate it into two phases, and bibliometric analysis suggests that there is still room for further exploration of nursing moral courage in terms of content and geography. However, this does not diminish its significance in addressing ethical dilemmas encountered in nursing practice. It is noteworthy that this paper also forecasts future research trends in nursing moral courage, indicating that researchers may strengthen research on nursing moral courage by adopting a global perspective, engaging in interdisciplinary studies, and focusing on nursing education. The results proposed in this paper can serve as a starting point for comprehensive or systematic literature reviews and seek more detailed data, information, and knowledge in the field of nursing moral courage. It can enable outsiders to quickly understand research on nursing moral courage, whether for in-depth exploration or simply to facilitate more effective collaboration with nursing ethics experts.

PZU models AI governance for the insurance industry
Insurer works with SAS AI Governance Advisory to protect customers and drive AI ethics
In a recent survey about the growing use of generative AI in insurance by data and AI leader SAS, 57% of insurance sector respondents described their organizations' AI governance and monitoring frameworks as ""in development."" More than a quarter (27%) said their frameworks were ""ad hoc or informal,"" and about 1 in 10 (11%) reported their AI governance was ""nonexistent.""
Against this backdrop, Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen S.A., better known as PZU, one of the largest financial institutions in central Europe, has worked with the SAS AI Governance Advisory to develop and implement a comprehensive AI governance framework. This framework protects customers, advances regulatory compliance and keeps the insurer on the leading edge of responsible innovation.
""While we are in an era of out-of-the-box AI solutions, data ethics is anything but one-size-fits-all,"" said Reggie Townsend, Vice President of Data Ethics at SAS. ""AI governance, customized to ensure safe deployment, is the future of industry AI.
""Regulatory compliance is just a starting point. Robust oversight guided by an organization's data maturity, unique culture and growth goals maximizes AI's value while limiting risk.""
Inspiring insurance evolution
PZU, a 200-year-old institution, has leveraged the potential of data across hundreds of integrated systems for nearly three decades. Several hundred AI and machine learning (ML) models drive essential business functions each day.
A pioneer in comprehensive data management, quality assurance and ethical use, PZU invested years ago in developing data governance practices, including establishing a team to set policies and coordinate data governance and quality processes.
As a surge of fresh regulation followed the post-ChatGPT AI boom, PZU's leadership quickly realized that modernizing its AI supervision and governance mechanism was a commitment not only to meeting compliance mandates but also to preparing for the future challenges of technology development.
PZU selected the SAS AI Governance Advisory, a new service for SAS customers, as one of the collaborators who would pilot the project. SAS' continued investment in responsible innovation, centered around its industry-leading Data Ethics Practice, determined the choice.
PZU has long trusted SAS solutions to pilot core business functions like sales and customer relationship management, fraud detection, claims automation, customer service and risk management. Establishing a new AI governance framework together was a logical next step.
Tailored to insure tomorrow
The SAS AI Governance Advisory consulted with PZU in four stages to create custom best practices for the insurer:
1. Oversight: Advising on PZU's innovation goals and helping them set policies for AI governance strategy and enforcement.
2. Compliance: Exploring PZU's compliance needs and discussing readiness for regulatory standards.
3. Operations: Reccommending operational procedures for AI and data management taking into account PZU's goals, regulatory requirements and the culture they aim to create.
4. Culture: Collaborating to foster positive social norms within the insurer's culture that would empower employees to adhere to trustworthy AI practices.
In the process, PZU and SAS experts defined policies for the entire lifecycle of all the insurer's AI/ML models to ensure adequate data quality, optimal resource use and continuous monitoring.
""Insurance policies are essential across all industries, giving insurers a unique role and influence in shaping responsible AI innovation,"" said Marek Wilczewski, Managing Director of Information, Data and Analytics Management at PZU. ""PZU intends to meet this challenge by harnessing the potential of data and AI to address key industry issues, the effects of climate change among them.
""This project with SAS is helping PZU better and more responsibly use AI to serve customers. We want to set an example for others: generating profits ethically, with responsible use of data and artificial intelligence, is not only possible - it's the only right way for insurers.""
""When thoughtfully implemented with appropriate guardrails, AI has the revolutionary potential to change the industry for the better; poorly applied, businesses risk amplifying mistakes and bias en masse,"" said Townsend. ""By going all in on AI governance, PZU is proving that industry heavyweights can lead us to a collective future where AI is used ethically, equitably and sustainably.""

PZU, a 200-year-old institution, has leveraged the potential of data across hundreds of integrated systems for nearly three decades. Several hundred AI and machine learning (ML) models drive essential business functions each day.
A pioneer in comprehensive data management, quality assurance and ethical use, PZU invested years ago in developing data governance practices, including establishing a team to set policies and coordinate data governance and quality processes.
As a surge of fresh regulation followed the post-ChatGPT AI boom, PZU's leadership quickly realized that modernizing its AI supervision and governance mechanism was a commitment not only to meeting compliance mandates but also to preparing for the future challenges of technology development.
PZU selected the SAS AI Governance Advisory, a new service for SAS customers, as one of the collaborators who would pilot the project. SAS' continued investment in responsible innovation, centered around its industry-leading Data Ethics Practice, determined the choice.
PZU has long trusted SAS solutions to pilot core business functions like sales and customer relationship management, fraud detection, claims automation, customer service and risk management. Establishing a new AI governance framework together was a logical next step.
Tailored to insure tomorrow
The SAS AI Governance Advisory consulted with PZU in four stages to create custom best practices for the insurer:
1. Oversight: Advising on PZU's innovation goals and helping them set policies for AI governance strategy and enforcement.
2. Compliance: Exploring PZU's compliance needs and discussing readiness for regulatory standards.
3. Operations: Reccommending operational procedures for AI and data management taking into account PZU's goals, regulatory requirements and the culture they aim to create.
4. Culture: Collaborating to foster positive social norms within the insurer's culture that would empower employees to adhere to trustworthy AI practices.
In the process, PZU and SAS experts defined policies for the entire lifecycle of all the insurer's AI/ML models to ensure adequate data quality, optimal resource use and continuous monitoring.
""Insurance policies are essential across all industries, giving insurers a unique role and influence in shaping responsible AI innovation,"" said Marek Wilczewski, Managing Director of Information, Data and Analytics Management at PZU. ""PZU intends to meet this challenge by harnessing the potential of data and AI to address key industry issues, the effects of climate change among them.
""This project with SAS is helping PZU better and more responsibly use AI to serve customers. We want to set an example for others: generating profits ethically, with responsible use of data and artificial intelligence, is not only possible - it's the only right way for insurers.""
""When thoughtfully implemented with appropriate guardrails, AI has the revolutionary potential to change the industry for the better; poorly applied, businesses risk amplifying mistakes and bias en masse,"" said Townsend. ""By going all in on AI governance, PZU is proving that industry heavyweights can lead us to a collective future where AI is used ethically, equitably and sustainably.""

Business Intelligence(BI) is a cornerstone of modern decision-making, leveraging vast data to uncover insights and drive strategy. However, as BI systems evolve, ethical concerns around privacy, transparency, and fairness become increasingly pressing. Mallikarjun Bussa, a prominent expert in data ethics, explores these challenges in his recent work, highlighting innovative solutions that organizations are adopting to navigate this complex landscape.
Bridging the Privacy Paradox with Cutting-Edge Techniques
The fundamental challenge in BI ethics is the ""privacy paradox"" the tension between extracting valuable insights and protecting individual privacy. Organizations are pioneering solutions like differential privacy, which mathematically obscures individual identities while maintaining analytical accuracy. Additionally, federated learning allows AI models to train across multiple decentralized datasets without data ever leaving its original location, significantly reducing privacy risks.
Another emerging approach is homomorphic encryption, enabling data analysis while keeping it encrypted. This technology is gaining traction in sectors like finance, where detecting fraud patterns without exposing sensitive financial information is critical. These innovations demonstrate that businesses do not have to choose between privacy and insight; they can achieve both with the right safeguards.
Combating Algorithmic Bias for Fairer Outcomes
BI-driven decisions impact hiring, lending, healthcare, and more, making algorithmic fairness crucial. Unchecked biases in training data can lead to discriminatory outcomes, but organizations are now implementing bias detection and mitigation frameworks to ensure fairness.
Pre-processing methods adjust data before training models, in-processing techniques constrain AI learning to prevent bias, and post-processing strategies correct biased outputs. By combining these methods, companies significantly reduce bias while maintaining accuracy. Moreover, diverse data science teams and continuous auditing of BI systems contribute to developing fairer, more ethical AI models.
Regular audits ensure ongoing compliance with ethical standards. Transparent documentation of bias mitigation strategies builds stakeholder trust and enables effective governance of AI deployment across enterprise environments.
Transparency as a Trust-Building Tool
Stakeholders increasingly demand visibility into how their data is used. Many businesses are responding by enhancing transparency through explainable AI (XAI) technologies such as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). These methods provide human-understandable justifications for AI decisions, fostering trust and improving regulatory compliance.
In addition to XAI, leading companies are introducing user-friendly data dashboards, allowing customers to see what data is collected and how it informs recommendations. Research shows that organizations prioritizing transparency experience higher customer retention and reduced legal risks, making it a win-win strategy.
Implementing Robust Ethical Safeguards
Beyond privacy and transparency, organizations are embedding ethics directly into BI design. Data minimization strategies ensure that only necessary information is collected, reducing privacy risks. Context-aware access controls prevent unauthorized data use by factoring in user roles, locations, and query patterns.
Many businesses are also adopting ""ethics-by-design"" approaches, where ethical impact assessments are conducted during system development rather than as a reactive measure. Regular audits further enhance accountability, identifying and mitigating potential ethical concerns before they escalate.
Cross-functional ethical review boards now provide governance throughout the AI lifecycle. Industry collaborations are establishing shared ethical standards, while regulatory frameworks increasingly mandate fairness assessments.
In conclusion,As BI technologies advance, ethical considerations will become even more integral to business strategy. The rise of global data protection regulations is driving standardization, making compliance frameworks more consistent across industries. Meanwhile, AI governance models are evolving to ensure that ethical safeguards keep pace with technological progress.Investing in ethical BI practices is not just about avoiding regulatory penalties it is a competitive advantage. Organizations with robust data ethics programs report stronger customer loyalty, reduced operational risks, and increased market valuation. As Mallikarjun Bussaemphasizes, the future belongs to businesses that can balance analytical power with responsible data stewardship.

The 20th International Pan Arab Critical Care Medicine Society (IPACCMS) Conference and the 1st Pan Arab Conference of the World Federation of Intensive and Critical Care societies, held in Kuwait, was a landmark event that brought together healthcare professionals, researchers, and thought leaders from across the globe. Organized by the Kuwait Anaesthesia and Critical Care Society, the conference attracted 1800 participants, featured 110 speakers, including 40 local experts, and delivered over 130 lectures across three parallel tracks. Additionally, 500 attendees participated in pre-conference workshops, which covered 14 specialized topics.
The conference fostered a vibrant exchange of knowledge and expertise. While the scientific programme covered a wide range of clinical topics, including sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in critical care, the ethical dimensions of healthcare were a recurring theme, both explicitly and implicitly. This Editorial captures reflection on the conference from a nursing ethics perspective, highlighting key ethical issues and their implications for critical care nursing practice, education, research, and leadership.
The pre-conference workshops from 30th to 31st January 2025 and 3-day main programme from 1st to 3rd February 2025 were rich with insights regarding the latest advances in critical care and medicine. Whereas there was only one explicit session on Day 3 of the main conference on ‘Ethical Challenges in Critical Care’, ethical issues and concepts were implicit in most sessions. At the beginning of each session, for example, speakers declared conflicts of interest; they weighed benefits and harms in relation to critical care treatment and research; they shared how they prioritized patient and family perspectives; and they highlighted the importance of ethical leadership, role modelling, and good teaching.
The pre-conference critical care nursing workshop, entitled ‘Advancing Excellence in Critical Care Nursing: Empowering Minds, Leadership, and Innovation,’ provided a platform for critical discussions on ethical challenges faced by nurses in Kuwait and beyond. The workshop explored the unique role of nurses as advocates, educators, and caregivers, while also addressing ethical dilemmas inherent in their practice. Key themes included multicultural working in healthcare; nurse advocacy; communication and respect; end-of-life care; ethics education and support; and culturally appropriate ethical frameworks.
Multicultural working in healthcare
Nurses often work in diverse teams and care for patients from varied cultural backgrounds. This diversity, while enriching, can also lead to ethical tensions, particularly when cultural beliefs conflict with medical recommendations or when communication barriers arise. The workshop emphasized the need for cultural competence and sensitivity in navigating these challenges. As Leininger1 notes in her seminal work on transcultural nursing, understanding and respecting cultural differences is essential for providing ethically sound and patient-centred care.
Nurse advocacy
Nurses frequently find themselves advocating for patients when families or other stakeholders may not appear to prioritize the patient’s best interests. This role requires moral courage, resilience, and a commitment to patient autonomy and dignity. According to Grace and Uveges,2 advocacy is a core ethical obligation of nursing, rooted in the profession’s commitment to safeguarding patient rights and well-being.
Communication and respect
Effective communication is a cornerstone of ethical care, yet disrespectful or dismissive behaviour in healthcare settings remains a challenge. Nurses must often mediate conflicts and ensure that all voices are heard, particularly in high-stakes critical care environments. Research by Brooks et al.3 highlights the importance of patient-centred communication in fostering trust and ensuring ethical care delivery.
End-of-life care
Ethical dilemmas surrounding end-of-life care were a recurring theme, especially in contexts where legal or cultural norms discourage the discontinuation of treatment. Nurses play a crucial role in balancing respect for cultural values with the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. As highlighted in a study by Gallagher et al.,4 nurses often experience moral distress when navigating end-of-life decisions, underscoring the need for ethical frameworks that support both patients and caregivers.
Ethics education and support
The workshop highlighted the need for robust ethics education and support systems to help nurses navigate moral distress and ethical unpreparedness. This includes fostering moral resilience, providing access to ethics consultations, and creating spaces for reflective practice. Rushton5 emphasizes the importance of moral resilience in enabling nurses to sustain their ethical commitment in the face of adversity.
Culturally appropriate ethical frameworks
Nurses are uniquely positioned to develop ethical frameworks that are culturally sensitive and context-specific. Such frameworks can empower nurses to deliver care that is both ethically sound and culturally respectful. As argued by Johnstone and Kanitsaki,6 culturally responsive ethics is essential for addressing the diverse needs of patients and families in a globalized healthcare environment.
Conclusions
In addition to these themes, the workshop also touched on the importance of moral resilience, interprofessional ethics, and the strengthening of nurses’ professional identity. Concepts such as non-abandonment and trustworthiness were emphasized as central to the ethics of care in critical care nursing. These principles align with the work of Tronto,7 who argues that care ethics – rooted in relationality, responsibility, and attentiveness – provides a robust foundation for ethical nursing practice.
The conference was a powerful reminder of the ethical complexities inherent in critical care nursing. It highlighted the need for ongoing dialogue, education, and support to equip nurses with the tools they need to navigate these challenges. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, particularly with the integration of advanced technologies like AI, the ethical dimensions of nursing practice will only grow in importance. The 20th IPACCMS served as a call to action for nurses, educators, and leaders to prioritize ethics in their practice and to continue advocating for patient-centred, culturally sensitive, and ethically grounded care.
In conclusion, the conference was not only a celebration of scientific and clinical advances but also a profound exploration of the ethical heart of critical care nursing. It reminded us that while technology and research are essential, it is the ethical commitment of nurses that truly sustains the humanity of healthcare. As we reflect on the insights gained, let us carry forward the lessons learned and continue to strive for excellence in both the science and the ethics of critical care nursing.

Load-Date: April 14, 2025","The 20th International Pan Arab Critical Care Medicine Society (IPACCMS) Conference and the 1st Pan Arab Conference of the World Federation of Intensive and Critical Care societies, held in Kuwait, was a landmark event that brought together healthcare professionals, researchers, and thought leaders from across the globe. Organized by the Kuwait Anaesthesia and Critical Care Society, the conference attracted 1800 participants, featured 110 speakers, including 40 local experts, and delivered over 130 lectures across three parallel tracks. Additionally, 500 attendees participated in pre-conference workshops, which covered 14 specialized topics.
The conference fostered a vibrant exchange of knowledge and expertise. While the scientific programme covered a wide range of clinical topics, including sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in critical care, the ethical dimensions of healthcare were a recurring theme, both explicitly and implicitly. This Editorial captures reflection on the conference from a nursing ethics perspective, highlighting key ethical issues and their implications for critical care nursing practice, education, research, and leadership.
The pre-conference workshops from 30th to 31st January 2025 and 3-day main programme from 1st to 3rd February 2025 were rich with insights regarding the latest advances in critical care and medicine. Whereas there was only one explicit session on Day 3 of the main conference on ‘Ethical Challenges in Critical Care’, ethical issues and concepts were implicit in most sessions. At the beginning of each session, for example, speakers declared conflicts of interest; they weighed benefits and harms in relation to critical care treatment and research; they shared how they prioritized patient and family perspectives; and they highlighted the importance of ethical leadership, role modelling, and good teaching.
The pre-conference critical care nursing workshop, entitled ‘Advancing Excellence in Critical Care Nursing: Empowering Minds, Leadership, and Innovation,’ provided a platform for critical discussions on ethical challenges faced by nurses in Kuwait and beyond. The workshop explored the unique role of nurses as advocates, educators, and caregivers, while also addressing ethical dilemmas inherent in their practice. Key themes included multicultural working in healthcare; nurse advocacy; communication and respect; end-of-life care; ethics education and support; and culturally appropriate ethical frameworks.
Multicultural working in healthcare
Nurses often work in diverse teams and care for patients from varied cultural backgrounds. This diversity, while enriching, can also lead to ethical tensions, particularly when cultural beliefs conflict with medical recommendations or when communication barriers arise. The workshop emphasized the need for cultural competence and sensitivity in navigating these challenges. As Leininger1 notes in her seminal work on transcultural nursing, understanding and respecting cultural differences is essential for providing ethically sound and patient-centred care.
Nurse advocacy
Nurses frequently find themselves advocating for patients when families or other stakeholders may not appear to prioritize the patient’s best interests. This role requires moral courage, resilience, and a commitment to patient autonomy and dignity. According to Grace and Uveges,2 advocacy is a core ethical obligation of nursing, rooted in the profession’s commitment to safeguarding patient rights and well-being.
Communication and respect
Effective communication is a cornerstone of ethical care, yet disrespectful or dismissive behaviour in healthcare settings remains a challenge. Nurses must often mediate conflicts and ensure that all voices are heard, particularly in high-stakes critical care environments. Research by Brooks et al.3 highlights the importance of patient-centred communication in fostering trust and ensuring ethical care delivery.
End-of-life care
Ethical dilemmas surrounding end-of-life care were a recurring theme, especially in contexts where legal or cultural norms discourage the discontinuation of treatment. Nurses play a crucial role in balancing respect for cultural values with the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. As highlighted in a study by Gallagher et al.,4 nurses often experience moral distress when navigating end-of-life decisions, underscoring the need for ethical frameworks that support both patients and caregivers.
Ethics education and support
The workshop highlighted the need for robust ethics education and support systems to help nurses navigate moral distress and ethical unpreparedness. This includes fostering moral resilience, providing access to ethics consultations, and creating spaces for reflective practice. Rushton5 emphasizes the importance of moral resilience in enabling nurses to sustain their ethical commitment in the face of adversity.
Culturally appropriate ethical frameworks
Nurses are uniquely positioned to develop ethical frameworks that are culturally sensitive and context-specific. Such frameworks can empower nurses to deliver care that is both ethically sound and culturally respectful. As argued by Johnstone and Kanitsaki,6 culturally responsive ethics is essential for addressing the diverse needs of patients and families in a globalized healthcare environment.
Conclusions
In addition to these themes, the workshop also touched on the importance of moral resilience, interprofessional ethics, and the strengthening of nurses’ professional identity. Concepts such as non-abandonment and trustworthiness were emphasized as central to the ethics of care in critical care nursing. These principles align with the work of Tronto,7 who argues that care ethics – rooted in relationality, responsibility, and attentiveness – provides a robust foundation for ethical nursing practice.
The conference was a powerful reminder of the ethical complexities inherent in critical care nursing. It highlighted the need for ongoing dialogue, education, and support to equip nurses with the tools they need to navigate these challenges. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, particularly with the integration of advanced technologies like AI, the ethical dimensions of nursing practice will only grow in importance. The 20th IPACCMS served as a call to action for nurses, educators, and leaders to prioritize ethics in their practice and to continue advocating for patient-centred, culturally sensitive, and ethically grounded care.
In conclusion, the conference was not only a celebration of scientific and clinical advances but also a profound exploration of the ethical heart of critical care nursing. It reminded us that while technology and research are essential, it is the ethical commitment of nurses that truly sustains the humanity of healthcare. As we reflect on the insights gained, let us carry forward the lessons learned and continue to strive for excellence in both the science and the ethics of critical care nursing.

2025 APR 21 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Robotics & Machine Learning Daily News Daily News -- Investigators publish new report on artificial intelligence. According to news reporting out of Brescia, Italy, by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""Machine Learning (ML) has historically been associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) but has developed into an independent discipline."" 
 Funders for this research include European Union-next Generation Eu, Mission 4, Component 2, Under Grant Agreement. 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Catholic University of the Sacred Heart: ""This paper argues for the ontological independence of ML, driven by its unique methodologies, applications, and ethical considerations. A bibliometric analysis reveals that ML research output (494,572 publications from 2017-2023) surpasses AI (283,762 publications) by 74%, reflecting its rapid growth and specialization. Unlike AI's pursuit of general intelligence and symbolic reasoning, ML focuses on data-driven performance optimization, with impactful applications in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and autonomous systems. The study highlights ethical challenges-such as addressing algorithmic bias (50 occurrences), fairness (2,778 publications), and environmental sustainability (283 related works)-which emphasize the need for dedicated ethical frameworks tailored to ML. These findings propose a conceptual and practical separation between ML and AI to enable targeted research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and solutions to challenges like explainability, transparency, and sustainability.""

Universal ethical values such as compassion, love, fairness, and respect for human rights, which have guided us through the ages, appear to be under threat in today’s ‘advanced’ world. We witness an increase in systemic injustice, violations of human rights, corruption in public offices, corporate scams, cybercrimes, and whatnot — not to mention ruthless anthropogenic activity leading to irreversible damage to the environment. Have we conveniently ignored Aristotelian ‘virtue’ in our rapacious quest for ‘excellence’?  
What would we pass on to our posterity? A legacy and a culture nurtured by ethical values? Or self-serving, perfidious formulae to achieve material gains at the cost of human well-being? These are pertinent questions to be addressed — if only we do not want to re-enact Hobbes’s ‘state of nature’ where life was ‘nasty, short, and brutal’.  
Here comes the relevance of ethics — the foundation for the existence of any society. How best we can ensure ethical values and practices to address dilemmas in personal, professional, and societal contexts is the challenge today.  
A study by Torney-Purta et al. (2001), IEA Civic Education Study, Amsterdam, Netherlands, underscores that new global realities call for a major reconsideration by educators and policymakers of how young people are being prepared to participate in democratic societies in the early 21st century, in order to preserve democratic values and institutions.  
Ethical education in India has hardly received the required primacy over academic excellence, for it has always been understood more as a principle than a practical pedagogic pursuit. The NEP 2020 emphasised the importance of fostering ethical values in education, aiming to cultivate well-rounded individuals with strong moral foundations. Though it seeks to integrate ethical values across all levels of education — from curriculum design to teacher training and assessment — there appears to be neither a structured framework nor a detailed roadmap to translate the intent into action.  
On the other hand, ethical education in the US and EU is on a much more advanced level, integrated into the basic structure of education at all levels, supported by federal as well as state initiatives. In K-12 schools (School Education), it is imparted through different pedagogic programs. The ‘Character Education’ program promotes the “Six Pillars of Character” — trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship — in assemblies and classroom discussions.  
‘Social and Emotional Learning’ (SEL) programs in states like California, Illinois, and New York focus on emotional intelligence and ethical decision-making. ‘Civics and Citizenship Education’ programs in states like Arizona and Florida teach democratic values, justice, and civic responsibility, with courses on subjects like fairness, equity, and the rule of law, and it is compulsory for students to pass the tests. ‘Digital Citizenship’ education programs teach digital ethics, focusing on responsible online behaviour, data privacy, etc.  
In the higher education system of the US, standalone dedicated courses are offered not only in STEM streams but also in professional programs like business and law. For instance, a Business Ethics course teaches corporate responsibility and ethical decision-making, whereas a Medical Ethics course focuses on patients’ rights, informed consent, and end-of-life care.  
Many centres like the Markkula Centre for Applied Ethics (Santa Clara University) are integrating ethics across different disciplines. Under the ‘Every Student Succeeds Act’ (ESSA), the US Department of Education assists Character Education through grants and programs which encourage SEL and a positive school atmosphere. In California and New Jersey, SEL or civics education is even made mandatory.  
Extracurricular and Community-Based Ethical Education is imparted through the engagement of students in community service projects and participation in groups like Model United Nations, Debate Clubs, or Ethics Bowl — to learn empathy, civic responsibility, and discuss global ethical dilemmas. Presently, in view of growing concerns about AI and misinformation, schools in the US have also incorporated AI ethics and media literacy into the curricula.  
According to ETHIKA, State of the Art Report, 2015, in six European countries — i.e., Austria, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, and Spain — though ethics and values education is not uniform, ethical themes and values such as willingness to help and support others, tolerance, multiculturalism, friendship, etc., were included at the pre-primary and kindergarten levels within different educational approaches and aligned with institutional guidelines. Support is provided to teachers in this regard by both public and private institutions in teaching skills and techniques.  
While Germany has a dedicated subject exclusively for ethics and ethical education at the primary and secondary levels, other countries incorporate them as part of broader subjects such as Civic and Social Values, Citizen and Homeland Culture, or Religious Education. Additionally, NGOs and independent institutions provide content or courses dedicated to ethical education, philosophy with children, dialogue, and reflective and critical thinking.  
However, both the US and the EU have their own challenges. In the former, decentralised policies, cultural debates, resource disparities, polarisation, and academic pressures seem to impede the desired levels of success; while in the latter, isolationist and racist movements, and cultural, ideological, or religious differences often pose challenges. Nevertheless, ethical education has been institutionalised and integrated into the education system at all levels with active cooperation from all stakeholders.  
A recent policy paper on Ethics and Values Education in Schools and Kindergartens — by the European Union, authored by Thomas Pfeil, Harry Underwood, et al. — underscores the need to inherently integrate ethics and values within school and education systems as a unified structure to address unprecedented challenges like migration and refugee crises, youth unemployment, the rise of populism and dominant identities, and digitalisation. The aim should be to stimulate ethical reflection, awareness, responsibility, and compassion in children so that critical thinking and reflection can foster ethical decision-making in contrast to prejudice, discrimination, and unethical attitudes.  
According to Steve Johnson, Director of Alternative Education at Santa Clara University, California, character education programs are a giant mutual-improvement process involving students, teachers, administrators, parents, and other stakeholders — and if integrated into the content and processes of instruction, schools can become models of ethical thought and values.  
In India, exclusive programs on ethical education hardly exist. Except for some professional courses in higher education, ethical education is not really a part and parcel of the general education system with a dedicated curriculum on ethics. Severe dearth of teachers, the increasing trend of meritocracy, commercialisation of education, and social inequalities are serious issues that make ethical education difficult either to pursue or enforce.  
However, the policy decision through the NEP holds promise for the future, provided these issues are addressed earnestly. Although it is difficult to replicate the successful examples from advanced countries, we can still make a difference in our own right. We need adequate financial and institutional support to integrate ethical education into the education system at all stages and ensure an ecosystem with synergy among educational institutions, civil society organisations, and stakeholders.  
In a multicultural, pluralistic society like India, adherence to ethical values cutting across social and religious identities is the key to the unity and strength of the nation. Hence, the importance of ethical education.

Load-Date: April 24, 2025","Universal ethical values such as compassion, love, fairness, and respect for human rights, which have guided us through the ages, appear to be under threat in today’s ‘advanced’ world. We witness an increase in systemic injustice, violations of human rights, corruption in public offices, corporate scams, cybercrimes, and whatnot — not to mention ruthless anthropogenic activity leading to irreversible damage to the environment. Have we conveniently ignored Aristotelian ‘virtue’ in our rapacious quest for ‘excellence’?  
What would we pass on to our posterity? A legacy and a culture nurtured by ethical values? Or self-serving, perfidious formulae to achieve material gains at the cost of human well-being? These are pertinent questions to be addressed — if only we do not want to re-enact Hobbes’s ‘state of nature’ where life was ‘nasty, short, and brutal’.

LRN Corp., a company focusing on ethics and compliance solutions, has released its 2025 Ethics & Compliance Program Effectiveness Report, 'Caught in the Middle.'
The company said the sweeping report delivers insights into widening performance gaps among ethics & compliance (E&C) programs, generational divides, and emerging riskslike artificial intelligence and global supply chain complianceshaping the E&C landscape worldwide.
""Ethics & compliance programs have never been more critical to organizational resilience and trust,"" said Kevin Michielsen, CEO of LRN Corp. ""This research shines a light on where organizations excel and where they must improve to meet the demands of a complex regulatory environment and an evolving workforce.""
This year's report highlights critical data points and reveals a stark disconnect between executive perceptions and employee experiences, underscoring the need for leadership to align more closely with front-line workers. It also exposes critical disparities between high- and medium-impact E&C programs, with high-impact programs pulling ahead through advanced tools and analytics.
In a release, the company noted the 2025 report uncovers major gaps in E&C programs, including:
Widening Resource Gaps: High-impact E&C programs are leveraging advanced tools, analytics, and benchmarking nearly twice as effectively as medium-impact programs. This resource disparity is driving a significant performance divide.
Leadership Disconnect: There remains a significant gap between executives and employees in perceptions of ethical culture, with over twice as many executives (79 percent) as employees (37 percent) believing middle managers consistently make decisions aligned with company values.
Unaddressed Emerging Risks: Adopting compliance measures for emerging risks, including artificial intelligence and supply chain vulnerabilities, lags by as much as 2.3x in medium-impact programs.
Generational Challenges: Gen Z employees are twice as likely to report skepticism about managerial fairness compared to other age groups, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies to build trust and engagement with the fastest-growing segment of the workforce.
""The report serves as a wake-up call for C-suite leaders to bridge the gap between strategy and execution,"" said Ty Francis, MBE, Chief Advisory Officer at LRN Corp. ""By focusing on transparency, accountability, and proactive risk management, organizations can transform compliance into a strategic advantage. This new and updated research is a direct juxtaposition of employee experiences with those of compliance professionals, providing a much deeper understanding of the alignment, or gaps, in perceptions of program effectiveness.""
'Caught in the Middle' highlights the power of continuous improvement, collaboration, and innovation in shaping the future of E&C. Based on surveys of over 1,500 professionals and 1,500 employees globally, the findings provide a roadmap for organizations to bridge gaps and seize opportunities to strengthen their programs, adapt to shifting landscapes, and bolster ethical cultures that thrive in today's complex business environment.

                      VIENTIANE (VIENTIANE TIMES/ANN) - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly shaping various sectors in Laos, contributing significantly to the country's digital transformation and socio-economic development.
The Ministry of Technology and Communications is spearheading efforts to integrate AI into government operations and private sector industries, with a focus on key areas such as labour, education, and the media.
At a recent workshop on AI workforce, governance, and ethics in Laos, Mr Bounpasith Phisamay, who is responsible for drafting the national AI strategy, shared insights on the progress being made.
The workshop, part of the effort to implement the UNESCO AI Ethics Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) in Laos, underscored the importance of establishing a clear regulatory framework for AI usage.
Mr Bounpasith explained several important definitions related to AI, specifically defining it as a digital technology that promises to transform Laos across various fields. The move aims to streamline governance and ensure that AI adoption aligns with national goals.
In a bid to modernise public administration, the Ministry of Technology and Communications has launched 37 digital government systems.
These systems are already improving the efficiency of essential services, such as tax collection and identity verification. The government is also developing a national digital identity system.
The initiative aims to seamlessly integrate services from both the public and private sectors, marking a significant step towards a fully digital public infrastructure.
AI is also making notable inroads into Laos' retail and manufacturing sectors, driving improvements in efficiency and productivity.
In retail, AI-powered technologies are enabling personalised customer experiences through tailored recommendations, as well as improving inventory management by analysing customer behaviour.
In the manufacturing sector, AI applications are being used for predictive maintenance, quality control, and optimising supply chains.
These applications are not only enhancing operational performance but also contributing to cost reductions, allowing businesses to remain competitive and improve their output.
The media is playing a crucial role in educating the public about the opportunities and risks associated with AI. Journalists are increasingly focusing on AI ethics and governance issues, raising awareness about the ethical implications of widespread AI use. As Laos continues to incorporate AI into various sectors, the media can help to ensure that citizens remain informed and engaged with these transformative technologies.
In an exciting development for Laos' legislative framework, the National Assembly recently held discussions on how AI could be integrated into parliamentary operations, and how digital tools and AI can improve legislative processes, including policy assessment, decision-making, and efforts to combat misinformation.
The government's strategy for AI adoption reflects a comprehensive approach, balancing the promotion of technological innovation with the careful consideration of ethics and governance.
As the country continues to explore and expand its AI capabilities, the potential benefits are clear-improved public services, enhanced industrial efficiency, and a more informed and engaged population.
The ongoing work in AI integration positions Laos as a promising player in Southeast Asia's digital economy, while ensuring that ethical considerations remain central to the country's AI initiatives.

The Cambodia Academy of Digital Technology (CADT) hosted a pivotal workshop on ""Validating Preliminary Results and Discussing Recommendations of UNESCOs Ethics of AI Readiness Assessment in Cambodia."" The event, presided over by H.E. Khov Makara, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPTC), was organized in collaboration with UNESCO and supported by MPTC. It brought together 120 representatives from various sectors, including ministries, agencies, associations, private companies, startups, research institutions, educational organizations, and civil society groups.
In his opening remarks, H.E. Khov Makara emphasized the critical role of the workshop in evaluating Cambodia's preparedness for ethical and responsible AI development. This process ensures inclusive stakeholder participation in AI development, and the insights gathered will be fundamental in shaping national policies and strategies, he stated. These efforts are aligned with Cambodias vision of achieving a robust digital economy and society by 2035 and contributing to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.
Mr. Sardar Umar Alam, UNESCO Representative to Cambodia, underscored the importance of embedding ethical considerations in AI innovations. As we navigate the AI wave, it is crucial that AI serves to empower individuals, reduce inequalities, and promote sustainable development in Cambodia, he noted.
The workshop focused on reviewing and validating the preliminary results of the UNESCO Ethics of AI Readiness Assessment in Cambodia and discussing strategic recommendations. These discussions aimed at fostering the ethical development and adoption of AI technologies across sectors.

Introduction
The CARE Principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) have emerged as a cornerstone for ethically managing data related to Indigenous peoples. Designed to complement the technical standards of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), CARE emphasizes the cultural, ethical, and social dimensions of data stewardship. These principles ensure that data governance prioritizes community well-being, respects local values, and protects the rights of vulnerable groups. While initially focused on Indigenous data, CARE’s ethical imperatives can – and should – be extended to other vulnerable communities. This comment explores how the CARE Principles can be applied to data governance in conflict-affected environments, ensuring ethical stewardship of sensitive information for vulnerable populations. While the discussion is framed through the lens of the Russo-Ukrainian war – focusing on internally displaced persons (IDPs) and civilians in occupied territories – the insights presented here have broader implications for humanitarian data management in other war-affected regions. By doing so, CARE can offer a unified ethical framework for addressing the challenges of data governance in complex humanitarian contexts.
Existing approaches to data governance, such as the FAIR principles, emphasize findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability to enhance data sharing and reproducibility. However, these principles, as outlined in recent studies, often require extensive curatorial efforts and may not fully address ethical concerns in conflict-affected areas. The Guidelines for Research Data Integrity (GRDI) further highlight the risks of data misinterpretation and the necessity of maintaining accuracy and transparency. Yet, neither FAIR nor GRDI explicitly account for the agency and rights of vulnerable populations over their data. This gap underscores the relevance of the CARE principles, which prioritize collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics in data governance. By integrating CARE principles into existing frameworks, humanitarian organizations can ensure that data governance aligns with both ethical and practical considerations in high-risk contexts.
The vulnerabilities of war-affected populations
The Russo-Ukrainian war has displaced millions, creating one of the largest displacement crises in Europe since World War II. Simultaneously, many individuals remain in occupied territories under precarious conditions. Both groups face heightened vulnerabilities linked to the collection and misuse of their data. For IDPs, the collection of personal information to coordinate humanitarian aid often results in privacy risks, ranging from data breaches to unauthorized use for non-humanitarian purposes.
For those in occupied territories, data misuse can result in repression or violence, especially if sensitive information falls into the hands of occupying authorities. A striking example is the use of digital records during so-called ‘filtration procedures,’ where occupying forces systematically verify individuals’ online activity, employment records, and prior affiliations to identify individuals deemed disloyal or politically undesirable. Reports from human rights organizations and independent investigators have documented cases where accessing certain digital content or having past government ties has led to arbitrary detentions and forced disappearances.
Therefore, managing such sensitive data requires stringent ethical safeguards. Recent research highlights the importance of anonymizing participants in conflict-affected regions and mandating the destruction of sensitive information post-project to prevent harm. This approach reflects a growing recognition of the critical intersection between data ethics and human security in conflict zones.
Adapting CARE to new contexts
The principles of CARE provide a flexible yet comprehensive ethical foundation that can be adapted to diverse contexts. Its emphasis on collective benefit ensures that data governance serves the well-being of communities, while authority to control empowers affected populations to govern their own data. Responsibility demands accountability from data stewards, and ethics ensures that data practices uphold the highest moral standards. These principles align closely with the needs of war-affected populations and can address critical gaps in existing data management practices.
Collective benefit
The principle of collective benefit ensures that data collection and use actively contribute to community well-being. For IDPs and residents of occupied territories, this could mean leveraging data to improve humanitarian assistance, facilitate family reunifications, and support long-term recovery efforts. Lessons from projects like FAIR Island demonstrate how aligning data governance with community-defined goals can amplify its social impact. Similarly, applying CARE in the Russo-Ukrainian context ensures that the primary focus of data use is the welfare of affected populations, not external interests.
A poignant example of the potential collective benefit is the documentation of forcibly deported Ukrainian children. A recent report by the Humanitarian Research Lab identifies 314 children illegally transferred to Russia, where they were subjected to forced re-education and naturalization, often separated from siblings and stripped of their Ukrainian identity. Such documentation is crucial for reuniting families, bringing these children back to Ukraine, and ensuring that these war crimes are meticulously recorded for international accountability. Ethically and securely collected data can serve as a powerful tool in exposing these atrocities. By integrating CARE principles into data governance, humanitarian organizations and researchers can ensure that collected data not only protects vulnerable populations, but also actively contributes to their empowerment and restitution.
Authority to control
This principle addresses the critical issue of data sovereignty. For Indigenous communities, CARE has empowered them to reclaim control over data historically misused by external entities. In the context of war, authority to control ensures that IDPs and those in occupied territories maintain autonomy over their personal information.
A compelling example of this principle in practice can be seen in how Ukrainian universities displaced due to occupation manage their online presence. To safeguard the identities of faculty members who remain in occupied territories but continue teaching online, Ukrainian universities have deliberately hidden their personal profiles from public access. Similarly, class schedules are withheld from public access to prevent sensitive operational details from being exploited. These measures highlight the importance of secure, community-controlled access to sensitive data, ensuring that the safety and autonomy of individuals are prioritized in crisis conditions.
Digital tools that enable such protections, akin to innovations like TK Labels for Indigenous knowledge, are vital in war contexts. By embedding the principle of authority to control into data governance, organizations can uphold the rights of vulnerable populations and safeguard them from potential harm, ensuring that data serves their interests rather than becoming a tool for persecutions.
Responsibility
Responsibility in data governance demands accountability and transparency from those collecting, managing, and using data. This is especially important in contexts of war, where mistrust of institutions is widespread. By adopting CARE, organizations managing data in the Russo-Ukrainian context would be compelled to minimize harm, ensure informed consent, and foster trust with affected communities. As Belarde-Lewis et al. highlight, responsibility includes building relationships with communities and ensuring that data practices align with their cultural and ethical values.
Responsibility in data governance must extend beyond the technical process of collection to actively fostering trust and ensuring inclusivity, particularly in regions impacted by war. As highlighted by Popova et al., universities in Ukraine are implementing policies and strategies aimed at encouraging young people to return and participate in rebuilding their communities. These efforts emphasize a holistic approach to trust-building and reintegration, focusing on documenting local needs and aspirations while fostering unity among displaced populations. By doing so, universities shape data policies that transcend mere information collection, promoting collective action and community resilience.
Applying this framework within the context of the Russo-Ukrainian war through the lens of the CARE Principles demonstrates how responsibility in data governance can be a catalyst for reconstructing societal structures and empowering affected communities. Universities play a crucial role in this process by managing a range of data, including student enrolment records, research archives, and institutional collaborations. These datasets support post-war recovery by facilitating the reintegration of displaced scholars, tracking educational disruptions, and preserving intellectual heritage amid conflict. For instance, academic records help internally displaced students resume their studies without bureaucratic obstacles, while research databases contribute to understanding long-term societal impacts of the war.
Ethics
The ethical dimension of CARE emphasizes the paramount importance of safeguarding the safety and dignity of individuals. In war zones, this principle becomes indispensable. Mishandling sensitive data can expose vulnerable populations to significant risks, such as targeted violence or stigmatization. The application of CARE ensures that data governance upholds rigorous ethical standards, actively protecting individuals from harm.
Wartime conditions give rise to new vulnerable groups, including those forcibly separated from their families, individuals unable to evacuate conflict zones, and people with disabilities who face heightened challenges in accessing aid and resources. These groups require particular attention to ensure their inclusion and protection in data practices. Ethical data governance must address these complexities by developing strategies to ensure that the unique needs of all vulnerable populations are met while mitigating harm. By adhering to CARE principles, institutions can ethically navigate these challenges, ensuring that their data practices prioritize both immediate security and long-term recovery for these at-risk groups.
Recent developments in data stewardship have acknowledged the challenges of implementing FAIR principles in practice, particularly in complex, interdisciplinary environments. A study by Fraga-González et al. introduced a pragmatic “FAIR enough” approach, suggesting that incremental adoption of FAIR principles is more feasible than rigid adherence. While this model provides flexibility, it does not directly address ethical concerns regarding data sovereignty and potential risks associated with misuse of sensitive datasets. In occupied cities, open data initiatives must be carefully assessed against potential risks, as seemingly neutral datasets – such as economic indicators or migration statistics – can be repurposed for surveillance and repression. This reinforces the argument that CARE principles are essential in complementing FAIR, ensuring that ethical accountability is central to data governance. As Plastun and Kozmenko highlight, the misrepresentation of stolen Ukrainian universities as Russian entities in international academic databases is not merely a technical oversight but a serious ethical failure. This erroneous attribution legitimizes the occupation, distorts the academic landscape, and allows occupying authorities to falsely claim the intellectual and institutional achievements of Ukrainian academia as their own. This is particularly critical in conflict settings, where data about internally displaced persons or vulnerable communities may be repurposed for non-humanitarian aims. In this regard, the CARE principles serve as a necessary complement to FAIR by ensuring that data governance prioritizes ethical accountability and community oversight.
Broadening CARE’s relevance and implications for global data governance
Some may contend that the CARE Principles, rooted in Indigenous contexts, are less applicable to other vulnerable groups. However, their adaptability has already been demonstrated across a variety of settings, from localized data stewardship projects to open science initiatives, Extending CARE to war-affected populations does not compromise their original intent; rather, it underscores their universality and relevance as a robust ethical framework.
The need to broaden the application of CARE is particularly pressing given the challenges posed by the global data economy. As conflicts and displacements become more frequent, vulnerable populations are often at risk of exploitation by systems that prioritize efficiency over ethics. For instance, in Ukraine, the drive to publish FAIR datasets – critical for transparency and scientific progress – can unintentionally expose individuals to harm if ethical considerations are overlooked. CARE ensures that data contributes to scientific advancements responsibly, balancing openness with the protection of human rights and the welfare of communities.
In Ukraine, initiatives like the 2022 Open Science Plan aim to increase transparency and competitiveness in research. Metrics such as the number of FAIR datasets published have been integrated into national evaluation criteria for research institutions. While these goals reflect progress, they must be tempered by the ethical demands of wartime realities. Data concerning displaced populations, occupied territories, or sensitive areas of research should not simply adhere to standards of openness, but must also be governed with care to avoid unintended harm. CARE principles provide this crucial safeguard, ensuring a balanced approach that retains the benefits of FAIR while mitigating the risks of uncritical data sharing. It is important to note that FAIR does not inherently imply openness; rather, it promotes well-structured and machine-readable data that can be accessed under clearly defined conditions. Sensitive datasets, particularly in humanitarian contexts, can adhere to FAIR principles while remaining restricted to authorized stakeholders to prevent misuse
The global significance of CARE lies in its capacity to establish a standardized ethical framework for data governance across a wide range of contexts. Vulnerabilities are not limited to Indigenous populations or those affected by war; they also encompass marginalized communities, climate refugees, and individuals whose sensitive data is at risk of exploitation in sectors such as health, migration, and education. Adopting CARE globally would provide a unified ethical foundation that complements FAIR, ensuring that data governance prioritizes humanity’s collective welfare. From mitigating biases in artificial intelligence to ensuring equitable access to digital resources, CARE principles offer a universal approach for embedding ethics into the rapidly evolving data-driven landscape.
Applying CARE to populations affected by war demonstrates its ability to address systemic vulnerabilities heightened by displacement, conflict, and the misuse of data. In such scenarios, CARE ensures that data governance is not solely about technical efficiency but also centres in justice, equity, and the empowerment of communities,.
The integration of FAIR and CARE principles provides a global standard that harmonizes openness with ethical responsibility, setting a transformative model for tackling future challenges. By embedding CARE into global data governance structures, we can build systems that not only protect and empower vulnerable populations but also uphold the ethical obligations of the scientific and data management communities.
Comparative analysis of CARE, FAIR, and international humanitarian data standards
The ethical and legal landscape of data governance in humanitarian contexts is shaped by multiple frameworks, including the FAIR principles, the CARE principles, and international humanitarian data protection standards established by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations (UN). While each of these frameworks offers valuable guidelines, they exhibit significant differences in scope, objectives, and applicability to conflict-affected populations or humanitarian crises.
FAIR principles focus on the technical and infrastructural aspects of data reusability, ensuring that datasets are structured for long-term scientific utility. However, they do not inherently provide guidance on ethical considerations or community control over sensitive data. Recent critiques highlight that FAIR implementation often entails substantial financial and administrative burdens, which may be impractical in humanitarian crises. Moreover, the Guidelines for Research Data Integrity emphasize the risks of data misinterpretation and advocate for strict methodological controls, yet they do not address power dynamics in data governance or the agency of vulnerable populations over their information.
In contrast, the CARE principles emphasize ethical imperatives, advocating for the collective benefit of data use and the prioritization of the rights of affected communities. This aligns with the ICRC’s approach to personal data protection, which underscores the need for strict limitations on data collection and use in humanitarian operations. Additionally, the ICRC’s Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action provides practical guidance on implementing data protection measures in crisis settings, particularly in relation to biometric data, cloud storage, and cross-border data transfers. The handbook highlights the risks of unauthorized access and repurposing of humanitarian data, reinforcing the necessity of ethical oversight mechanisms, such as those proposed under the CARE framework. Similarly, the UN Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles emphasize the importance of data minimization, informed consent, and purpose limitation, ensuring that personal data is not repurposed in ways that could harm vulnerable populations.
Legal analyses further demonstrate gaps in current frameworks. Kelemen highlights the absence of explicit protections for digital data in international humanitarian law (IHL), noting that electronic records do not enjoy the same safeguards as physical objects. This legal ambiguity is particularly concerning given the increasing militarization of digital data, where biometric databases and online records can become strategic assets in armed conflicts. Such concerns reinforce the argument that the FAIR framework alone is insufficient in conflict scenarios, and that the ethical and community-driven perspectives of CARE must be integrated into data governance protocols. A structured comparison of these frameworks is presented in Table , illustrating their key attributes and areas of overlap.
Comparative analysis of CARE, FAIR, and international humanitarian data standards in conflict-affected contexts.
Conclusion
The CARE Principles provide a robust and adaptable framework for ethical data governance, emphasizing the rights and welfare of vulnerable populations. Their application to communities impacted by the Russo-Ukrainian war highlights their broader relevance and potential as a universal ethical standard. By incorporating CARE, data practices can avoid causing harm and instead serve as tools for fostering resilience, supporting recovery, and advancing justice. This approach honours the dignity of war-affected populations and sets a transformative precedent for managing data in a world increasingly shaped by interconnected crises and conflicts.
This analysis underscores the necessity of integrating ethical and community-driven frameworks, such as CARE, into existing humanitarian and scientific data governance models. While FAIR principles remain fundamental for ensuring data usability, their limitations in conflict settings highlight the importance of complementary frameworks that prioritize accountability and affected populations’ rights. By advocating for explicit recognition of CARE within international humanitarian data policies – including ICRC and UN guidelines – this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on responsible data stewardship in crisis contexts.
In light of these insights, we urge researchers, policymakers, and organizations to actively engage in a dialogue about integrating CARE principles into their data governance frameworks. Such adoption will not only advance scientific progress but also ensure that data management prioritizes the dignity, security, and empowerment of vulnerable communities around the globe. By embedding CARE into global practices, we can build a foundation for ethical and equitable data governance in a rapidly changing world.

The global significance of CARE lies in its capacity to establish a standardized ethical framework for data governance across a wide range of contexts. Vulnerabilities are not limited to Indigenous populations or those affected by war; they also encompass marginalized communities, climate refugees, and individuals whose sensitive data is at risk of exploitation in sectors such as health, migration, and education. Adopting CARE globally would provide a unified ethical foundation that complements FAIR, ensuring that data governance prioritizes humanity’s collective welfare. From mitigating biases in artificial intelligence to ensuring equitable access to digital resources, CARE principles offer a universal approach for embedding ethics into the rapidly evolving data-driven landscape.
Applying CARE to populations affected by war demonstrates its ability to address systemic vulnerabilities heightened by displacement, conflict, and the misuse of data. In such scenarios, CARE ensures that data governance is not solely about technical efficiency but also centres in justice, equity, and the empowerment of communities,.
The integration of FAIR and CARE principles provides a global standard that harmonizes openness with ethical responsibility, setting a transformative model for tackling future challenges. By embedding CARE into global data governance structures, we can build systems that not only protect and empower vulnerable populations but also uphold the ethical obligations of the scientific and data management communities.
Comparative analysis of CARE, FAIR, and international humanitarian data standards
The ethical and legal landscape of data governance in humanitarian contexts is shaped by multiple frameworks, including the FAIR principles, the CARE principles, and international humanitarian data protection standards established by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations (UN). While each of these frameworks offers valuable guidelines, they exhibit significant differences in scope, objectives, and applicability to conflict-affected populations or humanitarian crises.
FAIR principles focus on the technical and infrastructural aspects of data reusability, ensuring that datasets are structured for long-term scientific utility. However, they do not inherently provide guidance on ethical considerations or community control over sensitive data. Recent critiques highlight that FAIR implementation often entails substantial financial and administrative burdens, which may be impractical in humanitarian crises. Moreover, the Guidelines for Research Data Integrity emphasize the risks of data misinterpretation and advocate for strict methodological controls, yet they do not address power dynamics in data governance or the agency of vulnerable populations over their information.
In contrast, the CARE principles emphasize ethical imperatives, advocating for the collective benefit of data use and the prioritization of the rights of affected communities. This aligns with the ICRC’s approach to personal data protection, which underscores the need for strict limitations on data collection and use in humanitarian operations. Additionally, the ICRC’s Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action provides practical guidance on implementing data protection measures in crisis settings, particularly in relation to biometric data, cloud storage, and cross-border data transfers. The handbook highlights the risks of unauthorized access and repurposing of humanitarian data, reinforcing the necessity of ethical oversight mechanisms, such as those proposed under the CARE framework. Similarly, the UN Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles emphasize the importance of data minimization, informed consent, and purpose limitation, ensuring that personal data is not repurposed in ways that could harm vulnerable populations.
Legal analyses further demonstrate gaps in current frameworks. Kelemen highlights the absence of explicit protections for digital data in international humanitarian law (IHL), noting that electronic records do not enjoy the same safeguards as physical objects. This legal ambiguity is particularly concerning given the increasing militarization of digital data, where biometric databases and online records can become strategic assets in armed conflicts. Such concerns reinforce the argument that the FAIR framework alone is insufficient in conflict scenarios, and that the ethical and community-driven perspectives of CARE must be integrated into data governance protocols. A structured comparison of these frameworks is presented in Table , illustrating their key attributes and areas of overlap.
Comparative analysis of CARE, FAIR, and international humanitarian data standards in conflict-affected contexts.
Conclusion
The CARE Principles provide a robust and adaptable framework for ethical data governance, emphasizing the rights and welfare of vulnerable populations. Their application to communities impacted by the Russo-Ukrainian war highlights their broader relevance and potential as a universal ethical standard. By incorporating CARE, data practices can avoid causing harm and instead serve as tools for fostering resilience, supporting recovery, and advancing justice. This approach honours the dignity of war-affected populations and sets a transformative precedent for managing data in a world increasingly shaped by interconnected crises and conflicts.
This analysis underscores the necessity of integrating ethical and community-driven frameworks, such as CARE, into existing humanitarian and scientific data governance models. While FAIR principles remain fundamental for ensuring data usability, their limitations in conflict settings highlight the importance of complementary frameworks that prioritize accountability and affected populations’ rights. By advocating for explicit recognition of CARE within international humanitarian data policies – including ICRC and UN guidelines – this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on responsible data stewardship in crisis contexts.
In light of these insights, we urge researchers, policymakers, and organizations to actively engage in a dialogue about integrating CARE principles into their data governance frameworks. Such adoption will not only advance scientific progress but also ensure that data management prioritizes the dignity, security, and empowerment of vulnerable communities around the globe. By embedding CARE into global practices, we can build a foundation for ethical and equitable data governance in a rapidly changing world.

Right now, as you read this article, algorithms are making decisions that affect everything from the price of the airline ticket we buy to the lives of soldiers in combat. What was once dystopian speculation is now the stuff of international law, and what was once a niche conversation among engineers is now a priority in multilateral forums.
The Global Conference on AI,Security and Ethics 2025 to be held this March 27-28 in Geneva is not just another event: it is the mirror of an urgent and as yet unanswered question: Who governs artificial intelligence? Since its inception, AI has been driven by promises: efficiency, precision, innovation. But behind these promises, there are also destabilizing risks that we are just beginning to understand.
The event in Geneva, organized by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research and Microsoft, will not revolve around product launches or performance metrics. Rather, it will be a global roundtable discussion on the moral and political limits of a technology that threatens to blur traditional notions of responsibility.
The agenda is as ambitious as it is necessary. From the invisible militarization of AI to the role of human oversight in autonomous systems. The experts that will be assembled will focus on the ethical dilemmas of AI use and its geopolitical consequences. Papers will address topics such as the use of autonomous drones in cities, the semantic dilemma between ""responsible AI"" and ""AI assurance"", and the social risks arising from algorithmic decisions.
Ethics, in this context, is the key to ensuring the survival of the human species. A recent example of this tension between ethical governance and technological power: theEuropean Union' s recent sanctionsagainst Google and Apple for violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA).
Last week, the European Commission declared that Google violated antitrust rules by favoring its own flight and hotel search services, and by preventing developers from directing users to alternative channels from Google Play. Apple, meanwhile, was singled out for limiting the interoperability of third-party devices with its ecosystem.
The EU argued that these practices restrict innovation, harm businesses and limit consumer freedom. Fines could reach 10% of annual global turnover, a figure measured in tens of billions of dollars.
Google responded that these changes jeopardize the security and quality of its services. Apple, for its part, warned that the decisions ""slow down its ability to innovate"". Both companies accuse the EU of compromising the user experience in the name of regulation. But isn't that precisely the central question - where does user experience end and the public interest begin? Where do you draw the line between algorithmic optimization and market capture?
The discussions in Geneva and the decisions in Brussels converge on one point: the need for ethical frameworks that are not too late. AI governance cannot be reactivated or dictated by the market. It has to be anticipatory, inclusive and, above all, fair.
If one thing has been becoming clear, it is that AI is not just about algorithms: it is about power. And as such, it deserves to be regulated with the same rigor as any structure that can shape the destiny of democracies. The question is not whether ethics can govern AI. The question is whether we will dare to do so before it is too late.

BusinessWire India
Singapore, April 18: SHRM in partnership with the Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP) launched a pioneering research report, ""HR Priorities with AI in the Workplace"", in Singapore at IHRP Office yesterday. This report provides an in-depth, data-driven analysis of how AI is being integrated into HR practices across the APAC region, with a focus on the Singapore context, shedding light on its impact, potential, and the obstacles organisations must overcome to fully leverage AI-driven solutions.
As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to redefine the world of work, HR leaders must navigate both its opportunities and challenges to build agile, future-ready organisations. AI is revolutionising HR functions, from recruitment and performance management to workforce planning, while also raising concerns about ethical governance, integration barriers, and evolving skill requirements.
Why This Report Matters
AI is no longer a future trend -- it is a present-day business imperative. From automating processes to augmenting decision-making, AI is redefining the role of HR. However, its successful adoption hinges on understanding not only its capabilities, but also its risks and implications. This first-of-its-kind report provides fresh insights into the state of AI adoption in HR, the top functions being transformed, and the critical enablers for responsible implementation.
Key Insights from the Report:
* AI Adoption Trends - 27% of organisations identified integrating AI into existing systems as a significant barrier. Whilst organisations across the APAC region are increasingly integrating AI into HR processes, some industries at the forefront of adoption while others are still in the early stages of implementation. The Leadership Dialogue focuses on trends of APAC with a focus on Singapore imperatives.
* Top HR Functions Impacted - AI is significantly transforming recruitment, learning & development, and performance management, in turn streamlining HR operations and enhancing decision-making.
* Integration Challenges - While AI promises efficiency, organisations face hurdles such as legacy system compatibility, skill gaps, and workflow disruptions when implementing AI-driven HR solutions.
* Ethical Considerations - 61% of organisations are concerned about ethical implications. The growing use of AI in HR calls for transparent governance, addressing concerns about bias, data security, and fair AI decision-making.
* Future Workforce Transformation - Organisations in the IT/ITeS, Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals and Manufacturing sectors have significant potential to accelerate AI adoption and bridge the existing gap. As AI reshapes the HR landscape, new roles and skill sets are emerging, redefining leadership capabilities and workforce strategies.
Official Launch at Exclusive Leadership Dialogue
The report was officially launched during the IHRP-SHRM Leadership Dialogue: AI and the Future of Work, held on 17 April 2025. The event convened more than 40 senior HR leaders, business executives, policymakers, and AI experts for a dynamic conversation on the future of work.
Aslam Sardar, CEO, IHRP, emphasised the importance of equipping HR professionals with the right knowledge to harness AI's full potential: ""As AI continues to drive transformation and accelerate change at the workplace, we encourage HR professionals to be equipped with current skillsets and knowledge to harness its full potential. By understanding AI's capabilities and ethical considerations, HR can drive innovation, enhance decision-making, and shape an AI-ready workforce.""
Achal Khanna, CEO, SHRM India, APAC & MENA, highlighted the significance of this initiative: ""The partnership between SHRM and IHRP exemplifies our dedication to building a future-ready workforce. By embracing the potential of AI and addressing its challenges, we can cultivate a more inclusive, efficient, and ethical approach to human resource management. With the launch of our report and the AI in HR Certificate Programme, we are equipping HR leaders with the vital knowledge and skills to harness AI effectively. Together, we will transform workforce strategies and pave the way for a resilient future in our organisations.""
The launch of ""HR Priorities with AI in the Workplace"" at the Leadership Dialogue reflects IHRP and SHRM's commitment to equipping HR professionals with the insights and tools needed to lead in an AI-enabled world. As organisations continue to adapt to rapid technological change, the report serves as a timely resource to guide responsible AI adoption and workforce transformation. The event marks an important step forward in fostering a future-ready, ethical, and human-centred HR ecosystem in Singapore and the region.

2025 JAN 22 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Robotics & Machine Learning Daily News Daily News -- Researchers detail new data in artificial intelligence. According to news reporting out of American Public University System by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is advancing at a rapid pace."" 
 Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from American Public University System: ""In addition, our older adult cohort is growing at an unprecedented rate. The purpose of my research is to address the ethical concerns when AI intersects with this population, offering policy recommendations to bridge this ethical digital divide. To address this AI ethical dilemma, my research did not reach back prior to 2019 in order to provide a concise policy analysis that includes existing AI ethical policies/recommendations from the European Union, United States, and U.S. States, key differences, and how ethical AI policies are central to Area Agencies on Aging's development of aging services. My findings indicated gaps in ethical AI design with developed policy recommendations. These gaps include inclusive data collection, user-centric design, algorithmic biases and understanding, digital literacy, New Jersey AI Task Force membership, and a need for a New Jersey AI Ethical Framework."" 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""With my five policy recommendations, New Jersey will be better positioned in assuring AI systems will be equitable, ethical, and effective in addressing the present and future needs of older adults. With this ethical AI framework, New Jersey will help to better older adults' quality of life, as well as save valuable time and resources through the new industrial revolution that is Artificial Intelligence.""

2025 APR 29 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Robotics & Machine Learning Daily News Daily News -- Current study results on robotics have been published. According to news reporting from the Department of Philosophy by NewsRx journalists, research stated, ""For Aristotle, human beings are deeply social creatures, a trait that contributes to the meaningfulness of our lives."" 
 The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Department of Philosophy: ""In more recent philosophy, Jean-Paul Sartre similarly argued that our existence is informed by our unavoidable social relations, even as he also emphasized the quest for individual freedom. What happens when the 'Other' in these relationships are artifacts, such as robots? Can robots liberate us from our existential dependence on other humans? Should they do so, in light of Aristotelian and Sartrean ethics? With recent technological advancements, an increasing amount of scholarly literature has emerged about the use, meaning, and limits of innovations such as sex- or love-robots. In this article, we will first explore the relevance of Aristotle's virtue ethics in relation to romantic love (eros) and social technologies. We will then examine Sartre's existentialism as in some respects a continuation of Aristotelian ethics and assess its applicability to eros in our technological age. Finally, we will conduct a case study on love-robots, reviewing recent scientific studies to evaluate their ethical and social implications from the perspectives of Aristotle and Sartre."" 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""We argue that neither Aristotle nor Sartre would endorse the view of love-robots as part of our social well-being."" 
 For more information on this research see: Aristotle and Sartre on Eros and Love-Robots. Open Philosophy, 2025,8(1):115-28. (Open Philosophy - https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opphil). The publisher for Open Philosophy is De Gruyter.

Load-Date: April 29, 2025","2025 APR 29 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Robotics & Machine Learning Daily News Daily News -- Current study results on robotics have been published. According to news reporting from the Department of Philosophy by NewsRx journalists, research stated, ""For Aristotle, human beings are deeply social creatures, a trait that contributes to the meaningfulness of our lives."" 
 The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Department of Philosophy: ""In more recent philosophy, Jean-Paul Sartre similarly argued that our existence is informed by our unavoidable social relations, even as he also emphasized the quest for individual freedom. What happens when the 'Other' in these relationships are artifacts, such as robots? Can robots liberate us from our existential dependence on other humans? Should they do so, in light of Aristotelian and Sartrean ethics? With recent technological advancements, an increasing amount of scholarly literature has emerged about the use, meaning, and limits of innovations such as sex- or love-robots. In this article, we will first explore the relevance of Aristotle's virtue ethics in relation to romantic love (eros) and social technologies. We will then examine Sartre's existentialism as in some respects a continuation of Aristotelian ethics and assess its applicability to eros in our technological age. Finally, we will conduct a case study on love-robots, reviewing recent scientific studies to evaluate their ethical and social implications from the perspectives of Aristotle and Sartre."" 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""We argue that neither Aristotle nor Sartre would endorse the view of love-robots as part of our social well-being.""

Sri Lanka, April 30 -- With the evolving landscape of global education, traditional teaching methods are being re-evaluated and transformed. Education is no longer just about books and exams. In today's rapidly changing landscape of modern education, the emphasis is predominantly on equipping students with knowledge and technical skills. While this focus is undoubtedly important, it is equally crucial to recognize and address the value-based dimension of education. Producing knowledgeable individuals but lacking core values poses significant challenges for both personal and societal development. Therefore, enriching the curriculum with core values is important, especially for developing countries like Sri Lanka's education system.
What do we predominantly emphasize as the primary goal of education? Often, it is to produce knowledgeable individuals to compete with the complexities of the dynamic world.
But is knowledge alone, though essential, sufficient to witness a developed country, a sustainable nation? The answer is a resounding NO. Basic values such as, but not limited to, empathy, integrity, respect, professional behaviour, responsibility, and accountability form the foundation of ethical behaviour and meaningful contributions to society. A person with values builds a nation with values.
Hence, now it is questionable whether Sri Lanka is a nation with values.
Are Sri Lankans actively living out these values? It is certain that without these values, individuals may excel in academic or professional domains but fall short in fostering positive interpersonal relationships, engaging in responsible citizenship, and addressing ethical dilemmas.
Let's look at some real issues we face when we ignore values in education.
Ethical and Moral Challenges: Individuals with extensive knowledge but lacking values may struggle with ethical decision-making. Professionals might excel in their fields yet make decisions that prioritize personal gain over the common good and the development of the country. For instance, who was behind the world-famous financial and audit scandals? Undoubtedly, many were caused by professionals who excelled in their technical field but had no ethical values. Their actions hurt entire communities and economies. Similarly, many organizations struggle with issues such as fraud, mismanagement, favouritism, and poor decision-making, not due to a lack of educated individuals, but due to a lack of integrity and responsibility among them.
Short-Term Gains Over Long-Term Impact: Merely focusing on knowledge from kindergartens can encourage a short-term, results-oriented mindset among individuals. This approach may prioritize immediate achievements and quick wins over long-term benefits. For example, a business that prioritizes quick profits by neglecting environmental regulations may boost its earnings and be lucrative temporarily, but certainly, it will result in a significant negative impact in the future.
Social Disconnect: An education system that emphasizes merely on knowledge without values can lead to a disconnect between individuals and the community. When empathy and respect are absent, it makes it difficult and challenging to build and maintain cohesive and supportive social networks all over the world.
So, what can we do?
To cultivate well-rounded individuals, education systems from kindergarten to higher education must adopt a more holistic approach that balances knowledge with values.
Here are a few simple steps that we can take to address this imbalance:
Integrating Values into the Curriculum: Education should include not only academic subjects but also courses on ethics, social responsibility, and emotional intelligence. By embedding these themes into the curriculum, students can learn to apply their knowledge in an ethically sound manner.
Modelling Ethical Behaviour: Revamping the curricula with values is not enough. Most importantly, educators and institutions must lead by example. Teachers, consultants, lecturers, and administrators in schools, universities, and all other educational institutions should demonstrate ethical behaviour and engage in practices that reflect the values they wish to instil in students.
Promoting Character Education: Especially the schools should implement character education programs that emphasize the development of core values. Activities such as community service, ethical debates, mentorship, and role model opportunities can reinforce these values. It prepares the students to become responsible, respectful, and caring citizens.
Encouraging Critical Reflection: Students should be encouraged to reflect critically on their actions and decisions. Discussions about real-world ethical dilemmas and societal issues can help them understand the importance of values in practical contexts.
Involving Families and Communities: Education does not occur in isolation. This can be implemented as a collaborative effort of teachers, parents, and community members to reinforce values and ensure that the principles taught at school are mirrored at home and in society.
Fostering a Supportive Environment: Creating a supportive and inclusive school environment is essential, where students feel valued and respected. This will help in developing their interpersonal skills and empathy. When students feel valued and respected, they are more likely to thrive both academically and socially. For instance, schools, universities, and all other educational institutions can encourage diversity and celebrate different cultures, use team-building activities and collaborative projects to strengthen connections, and ensure access to counselling and mental health resources.
Considering the above, focusing solely on producing knowledgeable individuals might be why some countries are still developing and far beyond the signs of a developed country. In an era with the replacement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all aspects, knowledge is readily accessible at any time and anywhere.
The challenge is not just gaining information and knowledge but cultivating values. Unlike knowledge, values cannot be simply memorized. They should be practised from kindergarten education. While knowledge is one of the fundamental components of education, the cultivation of values is equally vital for a sustainable and thriving nation. A balanced approach that integrates both aspects will not only produce competent individuals but also responsible and empathetic citizens. By addressing the challenges associated with prioritizing knowledge over values, we can work towards an education system that truly prepares individuals to thrive both personally and professionally while contributing meaningfully and positively to the broader society.

 22 Feb 2025 (Antara News Agency) Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesian Deputy Minister of Communication and Digital Affairs Nezar Patria underscored the need to adopt good practices to foster ethics in artificial intelligence (AI) development and use.AI ethics not only help ensure that AI development and use benefit society but also prevent the negative risks associated with this technology.
""An improvement is recorded recently, with around 80 percent of companies that use AI having a kind of ethical guidelines in AI development,"" Nezar remarked at the Tech and Telco Summit 2025, which he joined virtually on Friday (February 20).The deputy minister emphasized that AI systems must be transparent and accountable, allowing the public to understand and trust them in line with AI ethics guidelines.
In addition, AI must be free from detrimental bias, and its use must be inclusive without any discrimination.""We must also pay attention to user data protection with clear procedures.
It is expected that AI developers will provide guidance or awareness to users about their personal data that may be used in AI development,"" Nezar explained.He further emphasized the need for a clear monitoring mechanism in AI technology, for instance, in sectors considered important, such as health.
ccording to Nezar, the use of AI in the health sector must be monitored more strictly at the sectoral and financial services levels.He affirmed that AI systems must also be designed to support human needs rather than undermine human values.
""Indonesia wants ethical, fair, and responsible AI,"" he concluded.Translator: Muhammad Fadlan Nuril Fahmi, Yashinta DifaEditor: PrimayantiCopyright ANTARA 2025.

In this modern era, as  artificial intelligence (AI) continues to integrate into various industries, Ashwin Choubey explores the critical role human testers play in ensuring AI systems' reliability, fairness, and transparency. With AI set to revolutionize sectors like healthcare, finance, and human resources, it is crucial to examine how human oversight remains indispensable in AI testing, preventing biases and ethical pitfalls automated systems often miss. Human testers are essential in addressing complex challenges that machines alone cannot fully comprehend, ensuring AI systems align with societal and ethical standards.
The Need for Human-Centric AI Testing
AI's rapid development is driving a profound shift in industries across the globe. By 2027, the global AI market is expected to reach $990 billion, reflecting a surge in AI adoption. While AI systems have demonstrated impressive capabilities, especially in healthcare diagnostics and financial risk management, the technology's widespread implementation comes with inherent risks, notably bias in machine learning models. Studies show that fairness metrics in AI can vary between 15% and 35%, especially in sensitive areas such as credit scoring and hiring processes. This highlights the need for rigorous, human-led testing that ensures AI systems remain fair, transparent, and accountable.
Automated testing tools have improved in efficiency, but they still struggle with detecting cultural nuances, contextual issues, and subtle ethical concerns that human testers excel at. The human element is crucial for identifying edge cases, biases, and societal impacts that AI systems alone cannot assess. Recent studies have shown that human involvement can reduce bias in AI models by up to 60%, improving the fairness of decision-making processes across various applications. Additionally, human testers ensure that AI solutions align with societal expectations and legal frameworks, maintaining trust in technology.
The Essential Role of Human Testers in Bias Detection
Human testers are instrumental in identifying and mitigating biases that can arise in AI models, particularly in the context of recruitment and HR management. In fact, human testers have proven to be far more effective at identifying societal and cultural biases in AI systems than automated methods. A systematic review found that human testers detected cultural and societal biases in 76.5% of cases where automated testing missed these issues. Human intervention led to a significant reduction in biased decision-making, reducing unfair hiring practices by 58%.
Ethical and Transparency Considerations
Human testers also play a key role in ethical oversight, especially in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance. In healthcare, human testers were able to identify privacy concerns and potential algorithmic biases in patient care scenarios with 79% accuracy, significantly reducing the risk of privacy violations. Furthermore, human testers have been crucial in resolving ethical conflicts in AI systems. In medical decision-making, human evaluators resolved 75% of ethical issues, ensuring that patient care recommendations adhere to established ethical guidelines. This active involvement ensures that AI systems remain aligned with evolving ethical standards and patient-centric care values.
A Collaborative Approach for Future Testing
The future of AI testing lies in the collaboration between human expertise and AI capabilities. While automated systems can process large datasets quickly and efficiently, human testers provide the nuanced understanding required to ensure fairness, detect subtle biases, and address ethical concerns. Collaborative testing approaches that combine the strengths of both human and AI systems have been shown to improve testing outcomes significantly. By enhancing human-AI cooperation, organizations can identify issues more efficiently while ensuring systems are aligned with human values.
In conclusion, as AI continues to evolve, human oversight remains essential in ensuring fairness, accuracy, and transparency. While automation enhances efficiency, it cannot replace human judgment in detecting biases and ethical concerns. Organizations must integrate human testers into AI development to build trust and accountability. The future of AI testing lies in a balanced collaboration between technology and human expertise, shaping ethical and responsible AI systems for generations to come.

New Delhi: As India Inc widely adopts artificial intelligence (AI), the Confederation   of Indian Industry (CII) has underscored   the need for board engagement   in using technology to its maximum,   while effectively dealing with challenges emerging from it. CII has released a ‘Guidebook on Effective   Adoption and Governance of AI for Board Leaders’, which will serve as a guideline for board of directors as they steer their firms towards responsible   and ethical AI adoption, the industry   body said on Sunday. 
The guidebook will act as a practical guide for organisations as they chart out a path to unleash the full potential of technology, while also building in mechanisms to protect them from potential   risks emerging from it. “The guidebook is set against the backdrop of artificial intelligence, which offers tremendous potential for innovation in business, products, services   and processes,” CII said. It emphasises “the criticality of establishing   and upholding clear and enduring   values for maintaining   accountability in using AI within business operations,” CII said. The guideline also outlines   values as it navigates the AI landscape   that will help organisations make decisions aligned with their ethical standards and include the interests of all stakeholders. “It focuses on adoption of values such as integrity, responsibility,   security, fairness, accountability, transparency, which can serve as a moral   compass, guiding the decision-making   processes and ensuring that the use of AI aligns with organisation’s ethical   standards,” CII said. The industry body said the guidebook emphasises the importance of congruity between AI strategies and corporate objectives, with the need to establish “accountability   , transparency in AI deployments”.

Jakarta, May 8 -- In a striking act of protest, over one thousand British musicians, including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, Cat Stevens, and Damon Albarn, released a silent album called Is This What We Want? on February 25, 2025.
The 12-track collection-which has also drawn support from Billy Ocean, Radiohead's Ed O'Brien, Bastille's Dan Smith, as well as Jamiroquai-features sound recordings of empty studios and performance spaces.
And it spells out a powerful message: ""The British government must not legalize music theft to benefit AI companies.""
The "" Is This What We Want?"" movement has emerged as a direct response to the UK government's AI Opportunities Action Plan, unveiled in late 2024.
Aimed at positioning the UK as an AI superpower, the plan proposes relaxing copyright restrictions, allowing AI companies to use lawfully accessed material-such as songs, lyrics, and recordings-for training purposes.
Musicians and industry leaders have decried this as ""legalized theft,"" arguing that it undermines the foundational property rights of creators.
The movement reflects a broader global debate about AI's implications for the music industry, raising critical questions about creativity, ownership, and fairness.
The protest resonates with the growing unease in the music industry about AI's dual nature.
On the one hand, AI offers transformative tools. Song generators, automated mastering, and personalized playlists enhance creativity and accessibility.
Some studies have demonstrated the significant role artificial intelligence (AI) can play in enhancing the creative process of musicians, who can utilize AI algorithms to analyze and generate musical compositions ( Briot, 2019 ).
The findings highlight the potential of AI to augment and transform the music-making process.
The ramifications of AI's integration into music are not all negative.
Tools such as Google's MusicLM or Meta's MusicGen democratize creation, enabling amateurs to compose and professionals to experiment.
Paul McCartney's use of AI to resurrect John Lennon's voice for a Beatles track in 2023 showcased its potential to bridge the past and present.
However, these innovations come with ethical questions. Even Paul now seems to regret his decision.
When AI trains on copyrighted music without consent, it raises questions about ownership and compensation. Who owns AI-generated music: the developer, the user, or no one?
The economic implications are significant. The UK music industry, which is among the world's largest, fears that unregulated AI could eat into its &#163;5 billion annual contribution to the economy.
In addition, substitution risks-where AI outputs replace human work-threaten jobs, affecting songwriters to session musicians.
Transparency is another concern: without knowing what data trains these systems, creators cannot ensure fair use.
The "" Is This What We Want?"" movement thus demands not a rejection of AI, but a framework where it supports rather than replaces or does away with human creativity.
This refers back to the AI Action Summit 2025, held in Paris on February 10-11, 2025. At the summit, 60 countries, including France, China, and Japan, signed a declaration on ""inclusive and sustainable"" AI, committing to ethical standards that prioritize human rights and transparency.
The UK and US abstained, citing concerns of regulatory overreach, which would not be economically beneficial.
This is alarming despite the summit resulting in a global consensus that AI's benefits-economic growth, innovation-must not come at the expense of fairness.
For the music industry, this translates into policies that protect creators while maximising AI's potential, a model the world should follow.
I have argued that a divided world on AI governance could risk the need for fair AI development ( The Jakarta Post, 20/02 ).
Globally, UNESCO has taken a leading role in addressing these dilemmas. Its Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence , adopted by 193 member states in 2021, provides a blueprint for ethical AI deployment.
It emphasizes transparency, accountability, and human-centered values, stressing that AI must enhance, not overshadow, human contributions.
In music, this means distinguishing between AI as a tool, for instance, to aid composition, and as a creator, for instance, to ensure copyright integrity and fair compensation.
UNESCO's guidelines advocate for clear labeling of AI-generated content and mechanisms to avoid harm, such as revenue-sharing models.
In 2024, UNESCO launched a series of initiatives and discussions to address AI's impact on creative sectors, including music, building on its 2021 Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence .
The programs involved global experts, musicians, and policymakers in developing practical tools like ethical AI certification and guidelines to ensure transparency and fairness.
Focused on protecting intellectual property, it promoted consent for data use and equitable revenue models for artists.
Pilot projects tested AI applications that enhance creativity while safeguarding cultural integrity, reinforcing UNESCO's commitment to a human-centered digital transition in music and beyond.
The 2021 Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence urges member states to integrate ethical AI principles into national policies, ensuring transparency, fairness, and respect for intellectual property in sectors like music.
Members are required to establish regulations requiring consent for AI data use, promote equitable revenue models, and label AI-generated content to protect creators.
The recommendation is non-binding, hence, non-compliance carries no legal consequences. Instead, it relies on moral and diplomatic pressure.
However, failure to act would entail reputational damage-an economic disadvantage in global markets favoring ethical AI-and cultural erosion.
The UK's decision to abstain from the AI Action Summit 2025 declaration in Paris aligns with its proposed copyright law changes, which favor AI innovation over fair and balanced AI regulation, as reflected in the AI Action Summit Declaration.
This opt-out model reflects a pro-industry stance that clashes with the summit's call for ""inclusive and sustainable"" AI.
For the UK's music industry, this risks setting a precedent for borderless music databases, enabling unregulated AI exploitation. So, what will be the consequences for Indonesia?
Indonesia, with weaker copyright enforcement, could face economic losses from music being mined, amplifying global inequities in creative rights.
The 2014 Copyright Law offers protections, but its enforcement is lacking, with digital platforms often hosting unlicensed content.
Musicians, especially indie artists, rely heavily on live performances due to limited royalties-a vulnerability exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Besides, Indonesia's vibrant music scene, blending traditional gamelan with modern pop and dangdut, contributes significantly to cultural identity.
However, there are no law instruments to protect the compositions if somehow, AI companies utilize them for their own commercial benefit.
The ""Is This What We Want?"" movement and UNESCO's guidelines hold lessons for Indonesia. They underline the urgent need for revising copyright law to address the AI issue.
First, Indonesia should adopt an opt-in system, requiring explicit consent for AI to use copyrighted material, aligning with international norms and protecting creators' rights.
Second, a royalty fund-referring to a similar concept to proposals in the UK-could ensure compensation when AI leverages existing works.
Third, transparency regulations mandating disclosure of training data would build trust and accountability.
Such reforms could transform Indonesia's music industry landscape. Strengthened protections would encourage investment in original content, fostering a creative economy.
And, AI could become a partner, instead of a predator, enabling artists to innovate while preserving cultural heritage and human authenticity.
However, the implementation requires political will, industry collaboration, and public awareness.
This is a big challenge given Indonesia's bureaucratic complexities and the digital divide in this big nation.

Paris: The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has issued the following press release:
As the world continues to embrace Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everything from governance to education, one question keeps resurfacing: Can we build AI that is not only smart, but also safe, inclusive, and accountable? That ’ s the core of what the AI Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) aims to explore. And on 8 April 2025, the conversation took a powerful turn in Hyderabad.
This was the third in a series of five consultations being organized across India, as part of a joint initiative by UNESCO and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). The aim? To craft an India-specific AI policy report that identifies strengths and opportunities for growth within India ’ s thriving AI ecosystem. This report will pave the way for the responsible and ethical adoption of AI across all sectors.
What is the RAM?The AI RAM is a powerful diagnostic tool, guided by the UNESCO Recommendations on the Ethics of AI, designed to help governments navigate the rapidly evolving world of AI. It assesses the readiness of AI systems, identifies gaps in governance, and provides actionable insights to foster a responsible, ethical AI ecosystem. UNESCO is conducting the RAM in over 60 countries, with several governments across the world drawing crucial insights from the studies, into their national AI initiatives.
Setting the tone: Ethics is not optionalThe day began with impactful opening remarks by Shri Jayesh Ranjan, Principal Secretary, I&C and IT, Government of Telangana, and Mr. Tim Curtis, Director and UNESCO Representative for South Asia. Together, they set the tone for the day—emphasizing that as India takes bold strides in AI innovation, it must do so with a firm grounding in ethics by design.
In August 2023, the Government of Telangana signed a Letter of Intent with UNESCO to advance the ethical development and use of AI. This collaboration focuses on capacity building, awareness, and contributing to UNESCO ’ s Global Observatory on AI Ethics—aligning our state ’ s innovation efforts with global values.Shri Jayesh RanjanSpecial Chief Secretary of the ITE&C and Industries & Commerce Departments, Government of TelanganaMr. Ranjan shared insights from Telangana ’ s AI Strategy and Implementation Roadmap, which was launched in 2024. He highlighted how the state is advancing AI skilling, procurement, and startup enablement to ensure AI benefits are widely shared.
Next, Mr. Curtis underscored that ethics isn ’ t just about compliance—it ’ s about intentional design choices. Through the RAM, he noted, UNESCO is helping countries like India embed ethical considerations across the AI lifecycle, from data collection to deployment.
A fireside chat on the future of AI in IndiaOne of the standout moments of the day was the fireside chat between Shri Abhishek Singh, CEO of the IndiaAI Mission and Additional Secretary, MeitY, and Shradha Sharma, Founder and CEO of YourStory.
If we can democratize access to information in the mother tongue of all people, then the 700 million people who are languishing at low incomes, will have their productivity go up. If their income goes up by use of AI, by use of technology, they will be able to help India moveuptheladder.Shri Abhishek SinghAdditional Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information TechnologyFrom scaling the IndiaAI Mission to developing India-ready foundational models, Shri Singh outlined a bold vision for how India can lead in the global AI landscape. He also emphasized the importance of international collaboration to shape AI governance frameworks that are fair and future-ready.
A panel powered by women in AINext up was a dynamic panel discussion titled “Shaping Ethics in AI Governance: Government and Multilateral Perspectives”.
The panel featured an incredible lineup: Ms. Kavita Bhatia (COO, IndiaAI Mission and Group Coordinator, MeitY), Dr. Preeti Banzal (Adviser/Scientist 'G', Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India), Dr. Krishnashree Achuthan, (Dean of PG Programs, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham), Ms. Rama Devi Lanka (Director of Emerging Technologies, Government of Telangana), Dr. James Wright (Programme Specialist, UNESCO). The discussion touched on how ethical AI needs to be tackled at multiple levels—from sub-national frameworks to national policies to global norms.
We believe that governance which we want to follow is both centralized and decentralized. Centralized, by bringing the best practices of the international forum, but decentralized from the perspective that they will be implemented in the Indian context by the states. This top-down approach and the bottom-up approach of AI governance will certainly give an edge to us as well as will help us to take our learnings to the global south.
Getting into the details: Breakout discussionsThe consultation wasn ’ t just about listening—it was about engaging. Participants broke out into four thematic groups to go deep into key issues:
Governance: What should institutional frameworks for ethical AI look like?
Workforce Readiness: How do we train the people building and using AI?
Infrastructure: What technical and policy infrastructure is needed to support safe AI?
Use Cases: How can ethics be integrated in real-world AI applications across sectors?
Each group surfaced challenges, opportunities, and recommendations that will feed into the India RAM report, being prepared as part of this nationwide exercise.What ’ s next?With successful consultations already held in New Delhi, Bengaluru, and now Hyderabad, the RAM initiative is moving forward with greater momentum.
